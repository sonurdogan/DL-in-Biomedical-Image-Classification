Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Left heart catheterization, left ventriculography, selective coronary angiography, and right femoral artery approach.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PROCEDURE:  Cardiac catheterization by:a. Left heart catheterization.b. Left ventriculography.c. Selective coronary angiography.d. Right femoral artery approach.COMPLICATIONS: None.MEDICATIONS1. IV Versed.
2. IV fentanyl.3. Intravenous fluid administration.4. Heparin 3000 units IV.INDICATIONS:  This 70-year-old Asian-American presents with chest pain syndrome, abnormal EKG suggesting an acute ST elevation, anterior myocardial infarction, being taken urgently to cardiac catheterization laboratory with possible coronary intervention.NARRATIVE:  After detailed informed consent had been obtained. Usual benefits, alternatives, and risks of the procedure had been discussed with the patient, she was agreeable to proceed. The patient was prepped, draped, and anesthetized in the usual manner. Using modified Seldinger technique a 6 French introducer sheath inserted into the right femoral artery. Next, 6 French 3D right coronary catheter was inserted and right coronary angiogram was obtained in various projections. Next, a 6 French JL4.0 left coronary catheter was inserted and left coronary angiogram was obtained in various projections. Next, 4 French pigtail catheter was inserted into left ventricle under fluoroscopic guidance. Left ventricular angiogram was performed. Pre and post angiogram LVEDP, LV, and aortic pressures were obtained. At the end of the procedure catheters were removed and the introducer sheath was secured. The patient was admitted to the TCU in stable condition.FINDINGSHEMODYNAMICS
LEFT HEART PRESSURES: LVEDP of 5, left ventricular systolic pressure of 81, central aortic pressure systolic 70, diastolic 20.LEFT VENTRICULOGRAPHY:  Left ventricular chamber size is normal. The distal half of the anterior wall of the entire apex and the distal half of the inferior wall are completely akinetic with hypercontractility of the basilar segments of the anterior and inferior wall. Calculated ejection fraction of 51%, which probably overestimates the overall effective ejection fraction. No LV thrombus or mitral regurgitation present.CORONARY ARTERIOGRAPHY1. RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY:  The RCA gives rise to a posterior descending artery and a small posterolateral branch. Angiographically the right coronary artery is normal.2. LEFT MAIN ARTERY: The left main vessel is angiographically normal, bifurcates into left anterior descending artery and circumflex system.3. LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY:  The LAD gives rise to a normal complement of septal branches, diagonal branches, and extends around the apex. Angiographically the mid left anterior descending artery and distal left anterior descending artery demonstrates systolic compression of the vessel lumen, consistent with myocardial bridging. The degree of myocardial bridging appears moderate in the mid vessel and mild in the distal segment. Otherwise, there is no evidence of atherosclerotic obstruction.4. CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY:  The circumflex gives rise to two large extremely tortuous marginal vessels that extend towards the apex. Angiographically, the circumflex artery is normal.
CONCLUSION:  This is a 70-year-old female with above clinical and cardiovascular history, who has angiographic evidence of a large anterior apical and inferior apical wall motion abnormality with angiographically patent coronary arteries with two segments of myocardial bridging involving the mid and distal left anterior descending artery. These angiographic findings are consistent with Takasubo syndrome, aka apical ballooning syndrome. The patient will be treated medically.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Increasing oxygen requirement. Baby boy has significant pulmonary hypertension.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
INDICATION FOR CONSULTATION:  Increasing oxygen requirement.HISTORY:  Baby boy, XYZ, is a 29-3/7-week gestation infant. His mother had premature rupture of membranes on 12/20/08. She then presented to the Labor and Delivery with symptoms of flu. The baby was then induced and delivered. The mother had a history of premature babies in the past. This baby was doing well, and then, we had a significant increasing oxygen requirement from room air up to 85%. He is now on 60% FiO2.PHYSICAL FINDINGSGENERAL: He appears to be pink, well perfused, and slightly jaundiced.VITAL SIGNS: Pulse 156, 56 respiratory rate, 92% sat, and 59/28 mmHg blood pressure.SKIN: He was pink.He was on the high-frequency ventilator with good wiggle.
His echocardiogram showed normal structural anatomy. He has evidence for significant pulmonary hypertension. A large ductus arteriosus was seen with bidirectional shunt. A foramen ovale shunt was also noted with bidirectional shunt. The shunting for both the ductus and the foramen ovale was equal left to right and right to left.IMPRESSION:  My impression is that baby boy, XYZ, has significant pulmonary hypertension. The best therapy for this is to continue oxygen. If clinically worsens, he may require nitric oxide. Certainly, Indocin should not be used at this time. He needs to have lower pulmonary artery pressures for that to be considered.Thank you very much for allowing me to be involved in baby XYZ's care.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure.2. Laryngeal edema.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure.2. Laryngeal edema.PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Tracheostomy change. A #6 Shiley with proximal extension was changed to a #6 Shiley with proximal extension.
INDICATIONS:  The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital with exacerbation of COPD and CHF. The patient had subsequently been taken to the operating room by Department of Otolaryngology and a direct laryngoscope was performed. The patient was noted at that time to have transglottic edema. Biopsies were taken. At the time of surgery, it was decided that the patient required a tracheostomy for maintenance of continued ventilation and airway protection. The patient is currently postop day #6 and appears to be unable to be weaned from ventilator at this time and may require prolonged ventricular support. A decision was made to perform tracheostomy change.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was seen in the Intensive Care Unit. The patient was placed in a supine position. The neck was then extended. The sutures that were previously in place in the #6 Shiley with proximal extension were removed. The patient was preoxygenated to 100%. After several minutes, the patient was noted to have a pulse oximetry of 100%. The IV tubing that was supporting the patient's trache was then cut. The tracheostomy tube was then suctioned.The inner cannula was then removed from the tracheostomy and a nasogastric tube was placed down the lumen of the tracheostomy tube as a guidewire. The tracheostomy tube was then removed over the nasogastric tube and the operative field was suctioned. With the guidewire in place and with adequate visualization, a new #6 Shiley with proximal extension was then passed over the nasogastric tube guidewire and carefully inserted into the trachea. The guidewire was then removed and the inner cannula was then placed into the tracheostomy. The patient was then reconnected to the ventilator and was noted to have normal tidal volumes. The patient had a tidal volume of 500 and was returning 500 cc to 510 cc. The patient continued to saturate well with saturations 99%. The patient appeared comfortable and her vital signs were stable. A soft trache collar was then connected to the trachesotomy. A drain sponge was then inserted underneath the new trache site. The patient was observed for several minutes and was found to be in no distress and continued to maintain adequate saturations and continued to return normal tidal volumes.COMPLICATIONS:  None.DISPOSITION:  The patient tolerated the procedure well. 0.25% acetic acid soaks were ordered to the drain sponge every shift.

NAME OF PROCEDURE:  Left heart catheterization with ventriculography, selective coronary arteriographies, successful stenting of the left anterior descending diagonal.INDICATION: Recurrent angina. History of coronary disease.TECHNICAL PROCEDURE:  Standard Judkins, right groin.CATHETERS USED: 6-French pigtail, 6-French JL4, 6-French JR4.ANTICOAGULATION:  2000 of heparin, 300 of Plavix, was begun on Integrilin.
COMPLICATIONS:  None.STENT:  For stenting we used a 6-French left Judkins guide. Stent was a 275 x 13 Zeta.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  I reviewed with the patient the pros, cons, alternatives and risks of catheterization and sedation including myocardial infarction, stroke, death, damage to nerve, artery or vein in the leg, perforation of cardiac chamber, resection of an artery, arrhythmia requiring countershock, infection, bleeding, allergy, and need for vascular surgery. All questions were answered and the patient decided to proceed.HEMODYNAMIC DATA:  Aortic pressure was within physiologic range. There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve.ANGIOGRAPHIC DATA1. Ventriculogram: Left ventricle was of normal size and shape with normal wall motion, normal ejection fraction.
2. Right coronary artery: Dominant. There was a lesion in the proximal portion in the 60% range, insignificant disease distally.3. Left coronary artery: The left main coronary artery showed insignificant disease. The circumflex arose, showed about 30% proximally. Left anterior descending arose and the previously placed stent was perfectly patent. There was a large diagonal branch which showed 90% stenosis in its proximal portion. There was a lesion in the 30% to 40% range even more proximal.I reviewed with the patient the options of medical therapy, intervention on the culprit versus bypass surgery. He desired that we intervene.Successful stenting of the left anterior descending, diagonal. The guide was placed in the left main. We easily crossed the lesion in the diagonal branch of the left anterior descending. We advanced, applied and post-dilated the 275 x 13 stent. Final angiography showed 0% residual at the site of previous 90% stenosis. The more proximal 30% to 40% lesion was unchanged.CONCLUSION1. Successful stenting of the left anterior descending/diagonal. Initially there was 90% in the diagonal after stenting. There was 0% residual. There was a lesion a bit more proximal in the 40% range.2. Left anterior descending stent remains patent.
3. 30% in the circumflex.4. 60% in the right coronary.5. Ejection fraction and wall motion are normal.PLAN:  We have stented the culprit lesion. The patient will receive a course of aspirin, Plavix, Integrilin, and statin therapy. We used 6-French Angio-Seal in the groin. All questions have been answered. I have discussed the possibility of restenosis, need for further procedures.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Thoracentesis. Left pleural effusion. Left hemothorax.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left pleural effusion.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left hemothorax.PROCEDURE:  Thoracentesis.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After obtaining informed consent and having explained the procedure to the patient, he was sat at the side of a stretcher in the emergency department. His left back was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Xylocaine 1% was used to infiltrate his chest wall and the chest entered upon the ninth intercostal space in the midscapular line and the thoracentesis catheter was used and placed, and then we proceed to draw by hand about 1200 mL blood. This blood was nonclotting and it was tested twice. Halfway during the procedure, the patient felt that he was getting dizzy and his pressure at that time had dropped to the 80s. Therefore, we laid him off his right side while keeping the chest catheter in place. At that time, I proceeded to continuously draw fluids slowly and then when the patient recovered we sat him up again and we proceed to complete the procedure.Overall besides the described episode, the patient tolerated the procedure well and afterwards, we took another chest x-ray that showed much improvement in the pleural effusion and at that particular time, with all the history we proceeded to admit the patient for observation and with an idea to obtain a CT in the morning to see whether the patient would need an pigtail intrapleural catheter or not.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," A 62-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and implanted defibrillator.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
A 62-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and implanted defibrillator.COMPARISON STUDIES: None.MEDICATION:  Lopressor 5 mg IV.HEART RATE AFTER MEDICATION: 64bpmEXAM:TECHNIQUE: Tomographic images were obtained of the heart and chest with a 64 detector row scanner using slice thicknesses of less than 1 mm. 80ccs of Isovue 370 was injected in the right arm.
TECHNICAL QUALITY:Examination is limited secondary to extensive artifact from defibrillator wires.There is good demonstration of the coronary arteries and there is good bolus timing.FINDINGS:LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY:The left main coronary artery is a moderate-sized vessel with a normal ostium. There is no calcific or non-calcific plaque. The vessel bifurcates into a left anterior descending artery and a left circumflex artery.LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY:
The left anterior descending artery is a moderate-sized vessel, with a small first diagonal branch and a large second diagonal branch. The vessel continues as a small vessel, tapering at the apex of the left ventricle. There is calcific plaque within the mid vessel, with dense calcific plaque at the bifurcation of the second diagonal branch. This limits evaluation of the vessel lumen, and although a flow-limiting lesion cannot be excluded, there is no evidence of a high-grade stenosis. There is ostial calcification within the second diagonal branch as well. The LAD distal to the second diagonal branch is small relative to the more proximal vessel, and this is worrisome for a proximal flow-limiting lesion.In addition, there is marked tapering of the D2 branch distal to the proximal and ostial calcific plaque. This is worrisome for either occlusion or a high-grade stenosis. There is only minimal contrast that is identified in the distal vessel.LEFT CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY:The left circumflex artery is a moderate-sized vessel with a patent ostium. There is calcific plaque within the proximal vessel. There is dense calcific plaque at the bifurcation of the OM1, and the AV groove branch. The AV groove branch tapers as a small vessel at the base of the heart. The dense calcific plaque within the bifurcation of the OM1 and the AV groove branch limits evaluation of the vessel lumen. There is no demonstrated high-grade stenosis, but a flow-limiting lesion cannot be excluded here.RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY:The right coronary artery is a moderate-sized vessel with a patent ostium. There is proximal mixed calcific and non-calcific plaque, but there is no flow-limiting lesion. The vessel continues as a moderate-sized vessel to the crux of the heart, supplying a small posterior descending artery and moderate to large posterolateral ventricular branches.
There is scattered calcific plaque within the mid vessel and there is also calcific plaque within the distal vessel at the origin of the posterior descending artery. There is no flow-limited lesion demonstrated.The right coronary artery is dominant.NONCORONARY CARDIAC STRUCTURE:CARDIAC CHAMBERS: There is diffuse myocardial thinning within the left ventricle, particularly within the apex where there is subendocardial calcification, consistent with chronic infarction. There is ventricular enlargement. There is no demonstrated aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm.CARDIAC VALVES: There is calcification within the left aortic valve cusp. The aortic valve is tri-leaflet. Normal mitral valve.PERICARDIUM: Normal.
GREAT VESSELS: There are atherosclerotic changes within the aorta.VISUALIZED LUNG PARENCHYMA, MEDIASTINUM AND CHEST WALL: Normal.IMPRESSION:Limited examination secondary to extensive artifact from the pacemaker wires.There is extensive calcific plaque within the left anterior descending artery as well as within the proximal second diagonal branch. There is marked tapering of the LAD distal to the bifurcation of the D1 and this is worrisome for a flow-limiting lesion, but there is no evidence of occlusion.
There is marked tapering of the D1 branch distal to the calcific plaque and occlusion cannot be excluded.There is dense calcific plaque within the left circumflex artery, and although a flow-limiting lesion cannot be excluded here, there is no evidence of an occlusion or high-grade stenosis.There is mixed soft and calcific plaque within the proximal RCA, but there is no flow limiting lesion demonstrated.There is diffuse thinning of the left ventricular wall, most focal at the apex where there is also dense calcification, consistent with chronic infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly, this is 73-year-old white male with history of multiple hospital admissions for COPD exacerbation and pneumonia who presented to the emergency room on 04/23/08, complaining of severe shortness of breath. The patient received 3 nebulizers at home without much improvement. He was subsequently treated successfully with supplemental oxygen provided by normal nasal cannula initially and subsequently changed to BiPAP.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the hospitalist service, treated with frequent small volume nebulizers, treated with IV Solu-Medrol and BiPAP support for COPD exacerbation. The patient also noted with poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with a rate in the low 100s to mid 100s. The patient subsequently received diltiazem, also received p.o. digoxin. The patient subsequently responded well as well received IV antibiotics including Levaquin and Zosyn. The patient made slow, but steady improvement over the course of his hospitalization. The patient subsequently was able to be weaned off BiPAP during the day, but continued BiPAP at night and will continue with BiPAP if needed. The patient may require a sleep study after discharge, but by the third day prior to discharge he was no longer utilizing BiPAP, was simply using supplemental O2 at night and was able to maintain appropriate and satisfactory O2 saturations on one-liter per minute supplemental O2 per nasal cannula. The patient was able to participate with physical therapy, able to ambulate from his bed to the bathroom, and was able to tolerate a dysphagia 2 diet. Note that speech therapy did provide a consultation during this hospitalization and his modified barium swallow was thought to be unremarkable and really related only to the patient's severe shortness of breath during meal time. The patient's chest x-ray on admission revealed some mild vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions that appeared to be unchanged. There was also more pronounced patchy alveolar opacity, which appeared to be, ""mass like"" in the right suprahilar region. This subsequently resolved and the patient's infiltrate slowly improved over the course of his hospitalization. On the day prior to discharge, the patient had a chest x-ray 2 views, which allowing for differences in technique revealed little change in the bibasilar infiltrates and atelectatic changes at the bases bilaterally. This was compared with an examination performed 3 days prior. The patient also had minimal bilateral effusions. The patient will continue with clindamycin for the next 2 weeks after discharge. Home health has been ordered and the case has been discussed in detail with Shaun Eagan, physician assistant at Eureka Community Health Center. The patient was discharged as well on a dysphagia 2 diet, thin liquids are okay. The patient discharged on the following medications.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1. Home oxygen 1 to 2 liters to maintain O2 saturations at 89 to 91% at all times.2. Ativan 1 mg p.o. t.i.d.3. Metformin 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d.4. Glucotrol 5 mg p.o. daily.5. Spiriva 1 puff b.i.d.
6. Lantus 25 units subcu q.a.m.7. Cardizem CD 180 mg p.o. q.a.m.8. Advair 250/50 mcg, 1 puff b.i.d. The patient is instructed to rinse with mouthwash after each use.9. Iron 325 mg p.o. b.i.d.10. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily.11. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. bedtime.12. Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. daily.13. Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.a.m.14. DuoNeb every 4 hours for the next several weeks, then q.6 h. thereafter, dispensed 180 DuoNeb ampule's with one refill.15. Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q.a.m. x3 days followed by 30 mg p.o. q.a.m. x3 days, then followed by 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. x5 days, then 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. x14 days, then discontinue, #30 days supply given. No refills.
16. Clindamycin 300 mg p.o. q.i.d. x2 weeks, dispensed #64 with one refill.The patient's aspiration pneumonia was discussed in detail. He is agreeable to obtaining a chest x-ray PA and lateral after 2 weeks of treatment. Note that this patient did not have community-acquired pneumonia. His discharge diagnosis is aspiration pneumonia. The patient will continue with a dysphagia 2 diet with thin liquids after discharge. The patient discharged with home health. A dietary and speech therapy evaluation has been ordered. Speech therapy to treat for chronic dysphagia and aspiration in the setting of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Total discharge time was greater than 30 minutes.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Left thoracotomy with total pulmonary decortication and parietal pleurectomy. Empyema of the chest, left.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Empyema of the chest, left.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Empyema of the chest, left.PROCEDURE:  Left thoracotomy with total pulmonary decortication and parietal pleurectomy.PROCEDURE DETAIL:  After obtaining the informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room, where he underwent a general endotracheal anesthetic using a double-lumen endotracheal tube. A time-out process had been followed and preoperative antibiotics were given.The patient was positioned with the left side up for a left thoracotomy. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A posterolateral thoracotomy was performed. It included the previous incision. The chest was entered through the fifth intercostal space. Actually, there was a very strong and hard parietal pleura, which initially did not allow us to obtain a good exposure, and actually the layer was so tough that the pin of the chest retractor broke. Thanks to Dr. X's ingenuity, we were able to reuse the chest retractor and opened the chest after I incised the thickened parietal pleura resulting in an explosion of gas and pus from a cavity that was obviously welled off by the parietal pleura. We aspirated an abundant amount of pus from this cavity. The sample was taken for culture and sensitivity.
Then, at least half an hour was spent trying to excise the parietal pleura and finally we were able to accomplish that up to the apex and back to the aorta __________ towards the heart including his diaphragm. Once we accomplished that, we proceeded to remove the solid exudate that was adhered to the lung. Further samples for culture and sensitivity were sent.Then, we were left with the trapped lung. It was trapped by thickened visceral pleura. This was the most difficult part of the operation and it was very difficult to remove the parietal pleura without injuring the lung extensively. Finally, we were able to achieve this and after the corresponding lumen of the endotracheal tube was opened, we were able to inflate both the left upper and lower lobes of the lung satisfactorily. There was only one area towards the mediastinum that apparently I was not able to fill. This area, of course, was very rigid but any surgery in the direction __________ would have caused __________ injury, so I restrained from doing that. Two large chest tubes were placed. The cavity had been abundantly irrigated with warm saline. Then, the thoracotomy was closed in layers using heavy stitches of Vicryl as pericostal sutures and then several figure-of-eight interrupted sutures to the muscle layers and a combination of nylon stitches and staples to the skin.The chest tubes were affixed to the skin with heavy sutures of silk. Dressings were applied and the patient was put back in the supine position and after a few minutes of observation and evaluation, he was able to be extubated in the operating room.Estimated blood loss was about 500 mL. The patient tolerated the procedure very well and was sent to the ICU in a satisfactory condition.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," A 74-year-old woman for Cardiology consultation regarding atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation after a fall. The patient denies any chest pain nor clear shortness of breath.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: I was kindly asked to see Ms. ABC who is a 74-year-old woman for cardiology consultation regarding atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation after a fall.The patient is somnolent at this time, but does arouse, but is unable to provide much history. By review of the chart, it appears that she fell, which is what she states when she got up out of a rocking chair and could not get herself off the floor. She states that 1-1/2 hours later she was able to get herself off the floor.The patient denies any chest pain nor clear shortness of breath.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes, end-stage renal disease from hypertension. She follows up with Dr. X in her office and has been known to have a small-to-moderate sized pericardial effusion since 11/07 that has apparently been followed and it appears that the patient was not interested in having diagnostic pericardiocentesis done. She had an echocardiogram today (please see also that report), which shows stable and small-to-moderate sized pericardial effusion without tamponade, normal left ventricular ejection fraction at 55% with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, mildly dilated right ventricular size, normal right ventricular ejection fraction, moderate mitral regurgitation and severe tricuspid regurgitation with severe pulmonary hypertension, estimated PA systolic pressure of 71 mmHg when compared to the prior echocardiogram done 08/29/07, previously the mitral regurgitation was mild and previously the PA systolic pressure was estimated at 90 mmHg. Other findings were not significantly changed including pericardial effusion description. She has a history of longstanding hypertension. She has been on hemodialysis since 1997 for renal failure, history of mini-strokes documented several years ago, history of seizure disorder, she has a history of right upper extremity edema and right breast enlargement from right subclavian vein occlusion. She has a history of hypertension, depression, hyperlipidemia, on Sensipar for tertiary hyperparathyroidism.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes, cholecystectomy, post fistula in the left arm, which has failed, and right arm, which is being used including number of operative procedures to the fistula. She follows up with Dr. Y regarding neurovascular surgery.
MEDICATIONS:  On admission:1. Norvasc 10 mg once a day.2. Aspirin 81 mg once a day.3. Colace 200 mg two at bedtime.4. Labetalol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.5. Nephro-Vite one tablet p.o. q.a.m.6. Dilantin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.7. Renagel 1600 mg p.o. t.i.d.8. Sensipar 120 mg p.o. every day.9. Sertraline 100 mg p.o. nightly.
10. Zocor 20 mg p.o. nightly.ALLERGIES:  TO MEDICATIONS PER CHART ARE NONE.FAMILY HISTORY: Unable to obtain as the patient becomes quite sleepy when I am talking.SOCIAL HISTORY: Unable to obtain as the patient becomes quite sleepy when I am talking.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unable to obtain as the patient becomes quite sleepy when I am talking.
PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 99.2, blood pressure ranges from 88/41 to 108/60, pulse 70, respiratory rate, 20, O2 saturation 98%. Height is 5 feet 1 inch, weight 147 pounds. On general exam, she is a pleasant elderly woman who does arouse to voice, but then becomes quite sleepy and apparently that is an improvement from when she was admitted. HEENT shows the cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic. She has moist mucosal membranes. Neck veins are difficult to assess, but do not appear clinically distended. No carotid bruits. Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly. No wheezes. Cardiac exam: S1, S2 regular rate, 3/6 holosystolic murmur heard with radiation from the left apex towards the left axilla. No rub, no gallop. PMI is nondisplaced. Abdomen: Soft, nondistended. CVA is benign. Extremities with no significant edema. Pulses appear grossly intact. She has evidence of right upper extremity edema, which is apparently chronic.DIAGNOSTIC DATA/LAB DATA:  EKGs are reviewed including from 07/07/09 at 08:31 a.m., which shows atrial fibrillation with left anterior fascicular block, poor R-wave progression when compared to one done on 07/06/09 at 18:25, there is really no significant change. The atrial fibrillation appears present since at least on EKG done on 11/02/07 and this EKG is not significantly changed from the most recent one. Echocardiogram results as above. Chest x-ray shows mild pulmonary vascular congestion. BNP shows 3788. Sodium 136, potassium 4.5, chloride 94, bicarbonate 23, BUN 49, creatinine 5.90. Troponin was 0.40 followed by 0.34. INR 1.03 on 05/18/07. White blood cell count 9.4, hematocrit 42, platelet count 139.IMPRESSION:  Ms. ABC is a 74-year-old woman admitted to the hospital with a fall and she has a history of vascular dementia, so her history is somewhat unreliable it seems and she is somnolent at that time. She does have chronic atrial fibrillation again documented at least present since 2007 and I found an EKG report by Dr. X, which shows atrial fibrillation on 08/29/07 per her report. One of the questions we were asked was whether the patient would be a candidate for Coumadin. Clearly given her history of small mini-strokes, I think Coumadin would be appropriate given this chronic atrial fibrillation, but the main issue is the fall risk. If not felt to be significant fall risk then I would strongly recommend Coumadin as the patient herself states that she has only fallen twice in the past year. I would defer that decision to Dr. Z and Dr. XY who know the patient well and it may be that physical therapy consult is appropriate to help adjudicate.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Fall assessment as per Dr. Z and Dr. XY with possible PT consult if felt appropriate and if the patient is not felt to be at significant fall risk, would put her on Coumadin. Given her history of small strokes as documented in the chart and her chronic atrial fibrillation, she does have reasonable heart rate control on current labetalol.2. The patient has elevated BNP and I suspect that is due to her severe pulmonary hypertension and renal failure and in the light of normal LV function, I would not make any further evaluation of that other than aggressive diuresis.3. Regarding this minimal troponin elevation, I do not feel this is a diagnosis especially in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and her small-to-moderate sized stable pericardial effusion again that has been longstanding since 2007 from what I can tell and there is no evidence of tamponade. I would defer to her usual cardiologist Dr. X whether an outpatient stress evaluation is appropriate for risk stratification. I did find that the patient had a prior cardiac stress test in 08/07 where they felt that there was some subtle reversibility of the anterior wall, but it was felt that it may be artifact rather than true ischemia with normal LV function seen on that study as well.
4. Continue Norvasc for history of hypertension as well as labetalol.5. The patient is felt to be a significant fall risk and will at least continue her aspirin 81 mg once a day for secondary CVA, thromboprophylaxis (albeit understanding that it is inferior to Coumadin).6. Continue Dilantin for history of seizures.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Left heart catheterization, LV cineangiography, selective coronary angiography, and right heart catheterization with cardiac output by thermodilution technique with dual transducer.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
EXAMINATION:  Cardiac catheterization.PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Left heart catheterization, LV cineangiography, selective coronary angiography, and right heart catheterization with cardiac output by thermodilution technique with dual transducer.INDICATION:  Syncope with severe aortic stenosis.COMPLICATIONS: None.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After informed consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in a post observed state. The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. After adequate conscious sedation and local anesthesia was obtained, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery and a 8-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral vein. Following this, a 7.5-French Swan-Ganz catheter was advanced into the right atrium where the right atrial pressure was 10/7 mmHg. The catheter was then manipulated into the right ventricle where the right ventricular pressure was 37/10/4 mmHg. The catheter was then manipulated into the wedge position where the wedge pressure was noted to be 22 mmHg. The pulmonary arterial pressures were noted to be 31/14/21 mmHg. Following this, the catheter was removed, the sheath was flushed and a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter was the advanced over the guidewire and the left main coronary artery was cannulated and selective angiogram was obtained in orthogonal views. Following this, the catheter was exchanged over the guidewire for 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter. We were unable to cannulate the right coronary artery. Therefore, we exchanged for a Williams posterior catheter and we were able to cannulate the right coronary artery and angiographs were performed in orthogonal views. Following this, this catheter was exchanged over a guidewire for a 6-French Langston pigtail catheter and the left ventricle was entered and left ventriculography was performed. Following this, the catheters were removed. Sheath angiograms revealed the sheath to be in the right common femoral artery and the right common femoral arteriotomy was sealed using a 6-French Angio-Seal device. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications.
DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS:  The left main coronary artery is a large vessel, which bifurcates into the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions. The left circumflex artery is a short vessel, which gives off one major obtuse marginal artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions. The left anterior descending artery has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities and gives off two major diagonal branches. There is a 70% ostial lesion in the first diagonal branch and the second diagonal branch has mild-to-moderate luminal irregularities. The right coronary artery is a very large dominant vessel with a 60% to 70% lesion in its descending mid-portion. The remainder of the vessel has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions. The left ventricle appears to be normal sized. The aortic valve is heavily calcified. The estimated ejection fraction is approximately 60%. There was 4+ mitral regurgitation noted. The mean gradient across the aortic valve was noted to be 33 mmHg yielding an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2.CONCLUSION:1. Moderate-to-severe coronary artery disease with a high-grade lesion seen at the ostium of the first diagonal artery as well as a 60% to 70% lesion seen at the mid portion of the right coronary artery.2. Moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2.3. 4+ mitral regurgitation.PLAN:  The patient will most likely need a transesophageal echocardiogram to better evaluate the valvular architecture and the patient will be referred to Dr Kenneth Fang for possible aortic valve replacement as well as mitral valve repair/replacement and possible surgical revascularization.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Pulmonary Function Test in a patient with smoking history.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
HISTORY:  Smoking history 50-pack years of smoking.INDICATION:  Dyspnea.PROCEDURE:  FVC was 59%. FEV1 was 45%. FEV1/FVC ratio was 52%. The predicted was 67%. FEF 25/75% was 22%, improved about 400-cc, which represents 89% improvement with bronchodilator. SVC was 91%. Inspiratory capacity was 70%. Residual volume was 225% of its predicted. Total lung capacity was 128%. IMPRESSION:1. Moderate obstructive lung disease with some improvement with bronchodilator indicating bronchospastic element.2. Probably there is some restrictive element because of fibrosis. The reason for that is that the inspiratory capacity was limited and the total lung capacity did not increase to the same extent as the residual volume and expiratory residual volume.3. Diffusion capacity was not measured. The flow volume loop was consistent with the above.

REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 48-year-old male who was initially seen in the emergency room on Monday with complaints of scapular pain. The patient presented the following day with subcutaneous emphysema and continued complaints of pain as well as change in his voice. The patient was evaluated with a CT scan of the chest and neck which demonstrated significant subcutaneous emphysema, a small right-sided pneumothorax, but no other findings. The patient was admitted for observation.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Hernia repair and tonsillectomy.ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.MEDICATIONS:  Please see chart.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Not contributory.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:GENERAL: Well developed, well nourished, lying on hospital bed in minimal distress.HEENT: Normocephalic and atraumatic. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular muscles are intact.NECK: Supple. Trachea is midline.CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm.ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended. Normoactive bowel sounds.EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, edema, or cyanosis.
SKIN: The patient has significant subcutaneous emphysema of the upper chest and anterior neck area although he states that the subcutaneous emphysema has improved significantly since yesterday.DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: As above.IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 48-year-old male with subcutaneous emphysema and a small right-sided pneumothorax secondary to trauma. These are likely a result of either a parenchymal lung tear versus a small tracheobronchial tree rend.RECOMMENDATIONS: At this time, the CT Surgery service has been consulted and has left recommendations. The patient also is awaiting bronchoscopy per the Pulmonary Service. At this time, there are no General Surgery issues.

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Metastatic glossal carcinoma, needing chemotherapy and a port.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Metastatic glossal carcinoma, needing chemotherapy and a port.PROCEDURES1. Open exploration of the left subclavian/axillary vein.2. Insertion of a double lumen port through the left femoral vein, radiological guidance.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After obtaining the informed consent, the patient was electively taken to the operating room, where he underwent a general anesthetic through his tracheostomy. The left deltopectoral and cervical areas were prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Local anesthetic was infiltrated in the area. There was some evidence that surgical procedure had happened in the area nearby and also there was collateral venous circulation under the skin, which made us suspicious that may be __________, but at any rate I tried to cannulate it subcutaneously and I was unsuccessful. Therefore, I proceeded to make an incision and was able to isolate the vein, which would look very sclerotic. I tried to cannulate it, but I could not advance the wire.
At that moment, I decided that there was no way we are going to put a port though that area. I packed the incision and we prepped and redraped the patient including both groins. Local anesthetic was infiltrated and then the left femoral vein was percutaneously cannulated without any difficulty. The introducer was placed and then a wire and then the catheter of the double lumen port, which had been trimmed to position it near the heart. It was done with radiological guidance. Again, I was able to position the catheter in the junction of inferior vena cava and right atrium. The catheter was looked upwards and the double lumen port was inserted subcutaneously towards the iliac area. The port had been aspirated satisfactorily and irrigated with heparin solution. The drain incision was closed in layers including subcuticular suture with Monocryl. Then, we went up to the left shoulder and closed that incision in layers. Dressings were applied.The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent back to recovery room in satisfactory condition.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Aortic stenosis. Insertion of a Toronto stentless porcine valve, cardiopulmonary bypass, and cold cardioplegia arrest of the heart.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Aortic stenosis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Aortic stenosis.PROCEDURES PERFORMED1. Insertion of a **-mm Toronto stentless porcine valve.2. Cardiopulmonary bypass.3. Cold cardioplegia arrest of the heart.ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  300 cc.INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS:  1200 cc of crystalloid.URINE OUTPUT:  250 cc.AORTIC CROSS-CLAMP TIME:  **CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS TIME TOTAL:  **
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered. Next the neck, chest and legs were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion. We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline median sternotomy incision. Dissection was carried down to the left of the sternum using Bovie electrocautery. The sternum was opened with a sternal saw. The chest retractor was positioned. Next, full-dose heparin was given. The pericardium was opened. Pericardial stay sutures were positioned. After obtaining adequate ACT, we prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass. A 2-0 double pursestring of Ethibond suture was placed in the ascending aorta. Through this was passed an aortic cannula connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine. Next a 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage. Through this was passed our venous cannula connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine. A 4-0 U-stitch was placed in the right atrium. A retrograde cardioplegia catheter was positioned at this site. Next, scissors were used to dissect out the right upper pulmonary vein. A 4-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right upper pulmonary vein. Next, a right-angle sump was placed at this position. We then connected our retrograde cardioplegia catheter to the cardioplegia solution circuit. Bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the interface between the aorta and pulmonary artery. The aorta was completely encircled. Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta. We then prepared to cross-clamp the aorta. We went down on our flows and cross-clamped the aorta. We backed up our flows. We then gave antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia solution circuit so as to arrest the heart. The patient had some aortic insufficiency so we elected, after initially arresting the heart, to open the aorta and transect it and then give direct ostial infusion of cardioplegia solution circuit. Next, after obtaining complete diastolic arrest of the heart, we turned our attention to exposing the aortic valve, and 4-0 Tycron sutures were placed in the commissures. In addition, a 2-0 Prolene suture was placed in the aortic wall so as to bring the aortic wall and root up into view. Next, scissors were used to excise the diseased aortic valve leaflets. Care was taken to remove all the calcium from the aortic annulus. We then sized up the aortic annulus which came out to be a **-mm stentless porcine Toronto valve. We prepared the valve. Next, we placed our proximal suture line of interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures for the annulus. We started with our individual commissural stitches. They were connected to our valve sewing ring. Next, we placed 5 interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures in a subannular fashion at each commissural position. After doing so, we passed 1 end of the suture through the sewing portion of the Toronto stentless porcine valve. The valve was lowered into place and all of the sutures were tied. Next, we gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia. Next, we sewed our distal suture line. We began with the left coronary cusp of the valve. We ran a 5-0 RB needle up both sides of the valve. Care was taken to avoid the left coronary ostia. This procedure was repeated on the right cusp of the stentless porcine valve. Again, care was taken to avoid any injury to the coronary ostia. Lastly, we sewed our non-coronary cusp. This was done without difficulty. At this point we inspected our aortic valve. There was good coaptation of the leaflets, and it was noted that both the left and the right coronary ostia were open. We gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia. The antegrade portion was given in a direct ostial fashion once again. We now turned our attention to closing the aorta. A 4-0 Prolene double row of suture was used to close the aorta in a running fashion. Just prior to closing, we de-aired the heart and gave a warm shot of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia. At this point, we removed our aortic cross-clamp. The heart gradually regained its electromechanical activity. We placed 2 atrial and 2 ventricular pacing wires. We removed our aortic vent and oversewed that site with another 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle. We removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter. We oversewed that site with a 5-0 Prolene. By now, the heart was de-aired and resumed normal electromechanical activity. We began to wean the patient from cardiopulmonary bypass. We then removed our venous cannula and suture ligated that site with a #2 silk. We then gave full-dose protamine. After knowing that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed the aortic cannula. We buttressed that site with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle. We placed a mediastinal chest tube and brought it out through the skin. We also placed 2 Blake drains, 1 in the left chest and 1 in the right chest, as the patient had some bilateral pleural effusions. They were brought out through the skin. The sternum was closed with #7 wires in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion. The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl. We closed the subcu tissue with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 PDS.

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Cardiac tamponade.2. Status post mitral valve repair.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Cardiac tamponade.2. Status post mitral valve repair.PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Mediastinal exploration with repair of right atrium.
ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal.INDICATIONS:  The patient had undergone mitral valve repair about seven days ago. He had epicardial pacing wires removed at the bedside. Shortly afterwards, he began to feel lightheaded and became pale and diaphoretic. He was immediately rushed to the operating room for cardiac tamponade following removal of epicardial pacing wires. He was transported immediately and emergently and remained awake and alert throughout the time period inspite of hypotension with the systolic pressure in the 60s-70s.DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken emergently to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. His chest was prepped and draped prior to induction under general anesthesia. Incision was made through the previous median sternotomy chest incision. Wires were removed in the usual manner and the sternum was retracted. There were large amounts of dark blood filling the mediastinal chest cavity. Large amounts of clot were also removed from the pericardial well and chest. Systematic exploration of the mediastinum and pericardial well revealed bleeding from the right atrial appendix at the site of the previous cannulation. This was repaired with two horizontal mattress pledgeted #5-0 Prolene sutures. An additional #0 silk tie was also placed around the base of the atrial appendage for further hemostasis. No other sites of bleeding were identified. The mediastinum was then irrigated with copious amounts of antibiotic saline solution. Two chest tubes were then placed including an angled chest tube into the pericardial well on the inferior border of the heart, as well as straight mediastinal chest tube. The sternum was then reapproximated with stainless steel wires in the usual manner and the subcutaneous tissue was closed in multiple layers with running Vicryl sutures. The skin was then closed with a running subcuticular stitch. The patient was then taken to the Intensive Care Unit in a critical but stable condition.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," DDDR permanent pacemaker. Tachybrady syndrome. A ventricular pacemaker lead was advanced through the sheath and into the vascular lumen and under fluoroscopic guidance guided down into the right atrium.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: DDDR permanent pacemaker.INDICATION:  Tachybrady syndrome.PROCEDURE: After all risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure were explained in detail to the patient, informed consent was obtained both verbally and in writing. The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Suite where the right subclavian region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. 1% lidocaine solution was used to infiltrate the skin overlying the left subclavian vein. Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, a thin-walled #18-gauze Argon needle was used to cannulate the left subclavian vein. A steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance. The needle was then removed over the guidewire and the guidewire was secured to the field. A second #18 gauze Argon needle was used to cannulate the left subclavian vein and once again a steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen. Likewise, the needle was removed over the guidewire and the guidewire was then secured to the field. Next, a #15-knife blade was used to make a 1 to 1.5 inch linear incision over the area. A #11-knife blade was used to make a deeper incision. Hemostasis was made complete. The edges of the incision were grasped and retracted. Using Metzenbaum scissors, dissection was carried down to the pectoralis muscle fascial plane. Digital blunt dissection was used to make a pacemaker pocket large enough to accommodate the pacemaker generator. Metzenbaum scissors were then used to dissect cephalad to expose the guide wires. The guidewires were then pulled through the pacemaker pocket. One guidewire was secured to the field.A bloodless introducer sheath was then advanced over a guidewire into the vascular lumen under fluoroscopic guidance. The guidewire and dilator were then removed. Next, a ventricular pacemaker lead was advanced through the sheath and into the vascular lumen and under fluoroscopic guidance guided down into the right atrium. The pacemaker lead was then placed in the appropriate position in the right ventricle. Pacing and sensing thresholds were obtained. The lead was sewn at the pectoralis muscle plane using #2-0 silk suture in an interrupted stitch fashion around the ________. Pacing and sensing threshold were then reconfirmed. Next, a second bloodless introducer sheath was advanced over the second guidewire into the vascular lumen. The guidewire and dilator were then removed. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the atrial lead was passed into the right atrium. The sheath was then turned away in standard fashion. Using fluoroscopic guidance, the atrial lead was then placed in the appropriate position. Pacing and sensing thresholds were obtained. The lead was sewn to the pectoralis muscle facial plane utilizing #2-0 silk suture around the ________. Sensing and pacing thresholds were then reconfirmed. The leads were wiped free of blood and placed into the pacemaker generator. The pacemaker generator leads were then placed into pocket with the leads posteriorly. The deep tissues were closed utilizing #2-0 Chromic suture in an interrupted stitch fashion. A #4-0 undyed Vicryl was then used to close the subcutaneous tissue in a continuous subcuticular stitch. Steri-Strips overlaid. A sterile gauge dressing was placed over the site. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac Catheterization Room in stable and satisfactory condition.PACEMAKER DATA (GENERATOR DATA):Manufacturer: Medtronics.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Left heart catheterization with coronary angiography, vein graft angiography and left ventricular pressure measurement and angiography.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:1. Left heart catheterization with coronary angiography, vein graft angiography and left ventricular pressure measurement and angiography.2. Right femoral selective angiogram.3. Closure device the seal the femoral arteriotomy using an Angio-Seal.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient with known coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and multiple risk factors of coronary disease, who had her last coronary arteriogram performed in 2004. She has had complaints of progressive chest discomfort, and has ongoing risks including current smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia to name a few. The decision was made to proceed on with percutaneous evaluation and possible intervention given her known disease and the possibility of disease progression.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization lab where her procedure was performed. She was prepped and prepared on the table; after which, her right groin was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. Then, a 6-French sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery over a standard 0.035 guide wire. Coronary angiography and left ventricular measurement and angiography were performed using a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery. A 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter to image the right groin and her artery and the saphenous vein graft conduit. Subsequently, a 6-French angled pigtail catheter was used to measure left ventricular pressures and to perform a power injection, a left ventriculogram at 8 mL per second for a total of 30 mL. At the conclusion of the diagnostic evaluation, the patient had selective arteriography of her right femoral artery, which showed the right femoral artery to be free of significant atherosclerotic plaque. Did have a normal bifurcation into the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries and to have an arteriotomy that was in the common femoral artery away from the bifurcation. As such, an initial attempt to advance a Perclose device failed to allow the device descend to _____ tract and into the appropriate position within the artery. As such, the Perclose was never deployed and was removed intact over the wire from the system. We then replaced this with a 6-French Angio-Seal which was used to seal the femoral arteriotomy with achievement of hemostasis. The patient was subsequently dispositioned back to the MAC Unit where she will complete her bedrest prior to her disposition to home.HEMODYNAMIC DATA: Opening aortic pressure 125/60, left ventricular pressure 108/4 with an end-diastolic pressure of 16. There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve on pullback from the left ventricle. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 55%. Mitral regurgitation was less than or equal to 1+. There was normal wall motion in the RAO projection.
CORONARY ANGIOGRAM: The left main coronary artery had mild atherosclerotic plaque. The proximal LAD was 100% occluded. The left circumflex had mild diffuse atherosclerotic plaque. The obtuse marginal branch which operates as an OM-2 had a mid approximately 80% stenosis at a kink in the artery. This appears to be the area of a prior anastomosis, the saphenous vein graft to the OM. This is a very small-caliber vessel and is 1.5-mm in diameter at best. The right coronary artery is dominant. The native right coronary artery had mild proximal and mid atherosclerotic plaque. The distal right coronary artery has an approximate 40% stenosis. The posterior left ventricular branch has a proximal 50 to 60% stenosis. The proximal PDA has a 40 to 50% stenosis. The saphenous vein graft to the right PDA is widely patent. There was competitive flow noted between the native right coronary artery and the saphenous vein graft to the PDA. The runoff from the PDA is nice with the native proximal PDA and PLV disease as noted above. There is also some retrograde filling of the right coronary artery from the runoff of this graft. The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending is widely patent. The LAD beyond the distal anastomosis is a relatively small-caliber vessel. There is some retrograde filling that allows some filling into a more proximal diagonal branch. The saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal was known to be occluded from the prior study in 2004. Overall, this study does not look markedly different than the procedure performed in 2004.CONCLUSION: 100% proximal LAD mild left circumflex disease with an OM that is a small-caliber vessel with an 80% lesion at a kink that is no amenable to percutaneous intervention. The native right coronary artery has mild to moderate distal disease with moderate PLV and PDA disease. The saphenous vein graft to the OM is known to be 100% occluded. The saphenous vein graft to the PDA and the saphenous vein graft to the LAD are open. Normal left ventricular systolic function.PLAN: The plan will be for continued medical therapy and risk factor modification. Aggressive antihyperlipidemic and antihypertensive control. The patient's goal LDL will be at or below 70 with triglyceride level at or below 150, and it is very imperative that the patient stop smoking.After her bedrest is complete, she will be dispositioned to home, after which, she will be following up with me in the office within 1 month. We will also plan to perform a carotid duplex Doppler ultrasound to evaluate her carotid bruits.

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Right hemothorax.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Right hemothorax.PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Insertion of a #32 French chest tube on the right hemithorax.ANESTHESIA:  1% Lidocaine and sedation.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This is a 54-year-old female with a newly diagnosed carcinoma of the cervix. The patient is to have an Infuse-A-Port insertion today. Postoperatively from that, she started having a blood tinged pink frothy sputum. Chest x-ray was obtained and showed evidence of a hemothorax on the right hand side, opposite side of the Infuse-A-Port and a wider mediastinum. The decision was made to place a chest tube in the right hemithorax to allow for the patient to be stable for transfer out of the operating room.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The area was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion. The area was anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine solution. The patient was given sedation. A #10 blade scalpel was used to make an incision approximately 1.5 cm long. Then a curved scissor was used to dissect down to the level of the rib. A blunt peon was then used to again enter into the right hemithorax. Immediately a blood tinged effusion was released. The chest tube was placed and directed in a posterior and superior direction. The chest tube was hooked up to the Pleur-evac device which was ________ tip suction. The chest tube was tied in with a #0 silk suture in a U-stitch fashion. It was sutured in place with sterile dressing and silk tape. The patient tolerated this procedure well. We will obtain a chest x-ray in postop to ensure proper placement and continue to follow the patient very closely.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Type 4 thoracoabdominal aneurysm.OPERATION/PROCEDURE:  A 26-mm Dacron graft replacement of type 4 thoracoabdominal aneurysm from T10 to the bifurcation of the aorta, re-implanting the celiac, superior mesenteric artery and right renal as an island and the left renal as a 8-mm interposition Dacron graft, utilizing left heart bypass and cerebrospinal fluid drainage.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  Patient was brought to the operating room and put in supine position, and general endotracheal anesthesia was induced through a double-lumen endotracheal tube. Patient was placed in the thoracoabdominal position with the left chest up and the hips back to a 30-degree angle. The left groin, abdominal and chest were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. A thoracoabdominal incision was made. The 8th interspace was entered. The costal margin was divided. The retroperitoneal space was entered and bluntly dissected free to the psoas, bringing all the peritoneal contents to the midline, exposing the aorta. The inferior pulmonary ligament was then taken down so the aorta could be dissected free at the T10 level just above the diaphragm. It was dissected free circumferentially. The aortic bifurcation was dissected free, dissecting free both iliac arteries. The left inferior pulmonary vein was then dissected free, and a pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on this. The patient was heparinized. Through a stab wound in the center of this, a right-angle venous cannula was then placed at the left atrium and secured to a Rumel tourniquet. This was hooked to a venous inflow of left heart bypass machine. A pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on the aneurysm and through a stab wound in the center of this, an arterial cannula was placed and hooked to outflow. Bypass was instituted. The aneurysm was cross clamped just above T10 and also, cross clamped just below the diaphragm. The area was divided at this point. A 26-mm graft was then sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture. The graft was brought into the diaphragm. Clamps were then placed on the iliacs, and the pump was shut off. The aorta was opened longitudinally, going posterior between the left and right renal arteries, and it was completely transected at its bifurcation. The SMA, celiac and right renal artery were then dissected free as a complete island, and the left renal was dissected free as a complete Carrell patch. The island was laid in the graft for the visceral liner, and it was sutured in place with running 4-0 Prolene suture with pledgetted 4-0 Prolene sutures around the circumference. The clamp was then moved below the visceral vessels, and the clamp on the chest was removed, re-establishing flow to the visceral vessels. The graft was cut to fit the bifurcation and sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture. All clamps were removed, and flow was re-established. An 8-mm graft was sutured end-to-end to the Carrell patch and to the left renal. A partial-occlusion clamp was placed. An area of graft was removed. The end of the graft was cut to fit this and sutured in place with running Prolene suture. The partial-occlusion clamp was removed. Protamine was given. Good hemostasis was noted. The arterial cannula, of course, had been removed when that part of the aneurysm was removed. The venous cannula was removed and oversewn with a 4-0 Prolene suture. Good hemostasis was noted. A 36 French posterior and a 32 French anterior chest tube were placed. The ribs were closed with figure-of-eight #2 Vicryl. The fascial layer was closed with running #1 Prolene, subcu with running 2-0 Dexon and the skin with running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular stitch. Patient tolerated the procedure well.

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
Ms. ABCD is a 42-year-old female who was admitted approximately 3 days ago with increasing shortness of breath secondary to pneumonia. She has a history of bipolar disorder and is on considerable pain medication regimen due to prior motor vehicle accident.She was evaluated this a.m. and was without any significant clinical change. Her white count has been improving and down to 12,000. A chest x-ray obtained today showed some bilateral infiltrates, but no acute cardiopulmonary change. There was a suggestion of a bilateral lower lobe pneumonitis or pneumonia.She has been on Zosyn for the infection.Throughout her hospitalization, we have been trying to adjust her pain medications. She states that the methadone did not work for her. She was ""immune"" to oxycodone. She had been on tramadol before and was placed back on that. There was some question that this may have been causing some dizziness. She also was on clonazepam and alprazolam for the underlying bipolar disorder.Apparently, her husband was in this afternoon. He had a box of her pain medications. It is unclear whether she took a bunch of these or precisely what happened. I was contacted that she was less responsive. She periodically has some difficulty to arouse due to pain medications, which she has been requesting repeatedly, though at times does not appear to have objective signs of ongoing pain. The nurse found her and was unable to arouse her at this point. There was a concern that she had taken some medications from home. She was given Narcan and appeared to come around some. Breathing remained somewhat labored and she had some diffuse scattered rhonchi, which certainly changed from this a.m. Additional Narcan was given as well as some medications to reverse a possible benzodiazepine toxicity. With O2 via mask, oxygenation was stable at 90% to 95% after initial hypoxia was noted. A chest x-ray was obtained at this time. An ECG was obtained, which shows a sinus tachycardia, noted to have ischemic abnormalities.
In light of the acute decompensation, she was then transferred to the ICU. We will continue the IV Zosyn. Respiratory protocol with respiratory management. Continue alprazolam p.r.n., but avoid if she appears sedated. We will attempt to avoid additional pain medications, but we will continue with the Dilaudid for time being. I suspect she will need something to control her bipolar disorder.Pulmonary Medicine Associates have been contacted to consult in light of the ICU admission. At this juncture, she does not appear to need an intubation. Pending chest x-ray, she may require additional IV furosemide.

Pulses grossly intact.DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA: Initial ECG shows atrial flutter.IMPRESSION:  Mr. A is a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the past, more recently is having breakthrough atrial flutter despite flecainide and we had performed a transesophageal echocardiogram-guided cardioversion for him in late 12/20/09, who now has another recurrence within the past 41 hours or so. I have reviewed again with him in detail regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of proceeding with cardioversion, which the patient is in favor of. After in depth explanation of the procedure with him that there would be more definitive resumption of normal sinus rhythm by using electrocardioversion with less long-term side effects, past the acute procedure, alternatives being continued atrial flutter with potential for electrophysiologic consultation for ablation and/or heart rate control with anticoagulation, which the patient was not interested nor was I primarily recommending as the next step, and risks including, but not limited to and the patient was aware and this was all done in the presence of his wife that this is not an all-inclusive list, but the risks include but not limited to oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, which would be less likely as I did confirm with the patient that he had been n.p.o. for greater than 15 hours, risk of induction of other arrhythmias including tachyarrhythmias requiring further management including cardioversion or risk of bradyarrhythmias, in the past when we had a cardioverter with 150 joules, he did have a 5.5-second pause especially while he is on antiarrhythmic therapy, statistically less significant risk of CVA, although we cannot really make that null. The patient expressed understanding of this risk, benefit, and alternative analysis. I invited questions from him and his wife and once their questions were answered to their self-stated satisfaction, we planned to go forward with the procedure.PROCEDURE NOTE: The patient received a total of 7 mg of Versed and 50 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrate-down sedation with good effect and this was after the appropriate time-out procedure had been done as per the Medical Center universal protocol with appropriate identification of the patient, position, procedure documentation, procedure indication, and there were no questions. The patient did actively participate in this time-out procedure. After the universal protocol was done, he then received the cardioversion attempt with 50 joules using ""lollipop posterior patch"" with hands-driven paddle on the side, which was 50 joules of synchronized biphasic energy. There was successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm, in fact this time there was not a significant pause as compared to when he had this done previously in late 12/09 and this sinus rhythm was confirmed by a 12-lead EKG.
IMPRESSION:  Cardioversion shows successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from atrial flutter and that is while the patient has been maintained on Coumadin and his INR is 3.22. We are going to watch him and discharge him from the Medical Center area on his current flecainide of 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening, atenolol 25 mg once a day, Coumadin _____ as currently being diagnosed. I had previously discussed with the patient and he was agreeable with meeting with his electrophysiologist again, Dr. X, at Electrophysiology Unit at General Hospital and I will be planning to place a call for Dr. X myself. Again, he has no ischemia on this most recent stress test and I suppose in the future it may be reasonable to get obstructive sleep apnea evaluation and that may be one issue promulgating his symptoms.I had previously discussed the case with Dr. Y who is the patient's general cardiologist as well as updated his wife at the patient's bedside regarding our findings.

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
This is a low stress, high rest 1-day protocol; however the patient had the resting study done today.CLINICAL INDICATION: Chest pain.INTERPRETATION:  The patient received 14.9 mCi of Cardiolite for the rest portion of the study and 11.5 mCi of Cardiolite for the stress portion of the study.The patient's baseline EKG was normal sinus rhythm. The patient was stressed according to Bruce protocol by Dr. X. Exercise test was supervised and interpreted by Dr. X. Please see the separate report for stress portion of the study.The myocardial perfusion SPECT study shows there is mild anteroseptal fixed defect seen, which is most likely secondary to soft tissue attenuation artifact. There is, however, mild partially reversible perfusion defect seen, which is more pronounced in the stress images and short-axis view suggestive of minimal ischemia in the inferolateral wall.
The gated SPECT study shows normal wall motion and wall thickening with calculated left ventricular ejection fraction of 59%.CONCLUSION:1. The exercise myocardial perfusion study shows possibility of mild ischemia in the inferolateral wall.2. Normal LV systolic function with LV ejection fraction of 59%.

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:1. Left heart catheterization.2. Bilateral selective coronary angiography.ANESTHESIA:  1% lidocaine and IV sedation, including fentanyl 25 mcg.INDICATION:  The patient is a 65-year-old male with known moderate mitral regurgitation with partial flail of the P2 and P3 gallops who underwent outpatient evaluation for increasingly severed decreased functional capacity and retrosternal chest pain that was aggravated by exertion and decreased with rest. It was accompanied by diaphoresis and shortness of breath. The patient was felt to be a candidate for mitral valve repair versus mitral valve replacement and underwent a stress test as part of his evaluation for chest pain. He underwent adenosine Cardiolite, which revealed 2 mm ST segment depression in leads II, III aVF, and V3, V4, and V5. Stress images revealed left ventricular dilatations suggestive of multivessel disease. He is undergoing evaluation today as a part of preoperative evaluation and because of the positive stress test.PROCEDURE:  After risks, benefits, alternatives of the above mentioned procedure were explained to the patient in detail, informed consent was obtained both verbally and writing. The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where the procedure was performed. The right inguinal area was sterilely cleansed with a Betadine solution and the patient was draped in the usual manner. 1% lidocaine solution was used to anesthetize the right inguinal area. Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, a thin-walled Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery.
The guidewire was then advanced through the lumen of the needle without resistance and a small nick was made in the skin. The needle was removed and a pressure was held. A #6 French arterial sheath was advanced over the guidewire without resistance. The dilator and guidewire were removed and the sheath was flushed. A Judkins left #4 catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of the guidewire. The guidewire was removed and the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed. The ostium of the left main coronary artery was carefully engaged and limited evaluation was performed after noticing that the patient had a significant left main coronary artery stenosis. The catheter was withdrawn from the ostium of the left main coronary artery and the guidewire was inserted through the tip of the catheter. The catheter was removed over guidewire and a Judkins right #4 catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with use of a guidewire. The guidewire was removed and the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed. The ostium of the right coronary artery was carefully engaged and using hand injections of nonionic contrast material, the right coronary artery was evaluated in both diagonal views. This catheter was removed. The sheath was flushed the final time. The patient was taken to the postcatheterization holding area in stable condition.FINDINGS:LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY: This vessel is seen to be heavily calcified throughout its course. Begins as a moderate caliber vessel. There is a 60% stenosis in the distal portion with extension of the lesion to the ostium and proximal portions of the left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary artery.LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING CORONARY ARTERY: This vessel is heavily calcified in its proximal portion. It is of moderate caliber and seen post anteriorly in the intraventricular groove and wraps around the apex. There is a 90% stenosis in the proximal portion and 90% ostial stenosis in the first and second anterolateral branches. There is sequential 80% and 90% stenosis in the mid-portion of the vessel. Otherwise, the LAD is seen to be diffusely diseased.LEFT CIRCUMFLEX CORONARY ARTERY: This vessel is also calcified in its proximal portion. There is a greater than 90% ostial stenosis, which appears to be an extension of the lesion in the left main coronary artery. There is a greater than 70% stenosis in the proximal portion of the first large obtuse marginal branch, otherwise, the circumflex system is seen to be diffusely diseased.RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY:  This is a large caliber vessel and is the dominant system. There is diffuse luminal irregularities throughout the vessel and a 80% to 90% stenosis at the bifurcation above the posterior descending artery and posterolateral branch.
IMPRESSION:1. Three-vessel coronary artery disease as described above.2. Moderate mitral regurgitation per TEE.3. Status post venous vein stripping of the left lower extremity and varicosities in both lower extremities.4. Long-standing history of phlebitis.PLAN:  Consultation will be obtained with Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery for CABG and mitral valve repair versus replacement.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," VATS right middle lobectomy, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, mediastinal lymph node sampling, tube thoracostomy x2, multiple chest wall biopsies and excision of margin on anterior chest wall adjacent to adherent tumor.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right middle lobe lung cancer.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Right middle lobe lung cancer.PROCEDURES PERFORMED:1. VATS right middle lobectomy.2. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy thus before and after the procedure.3. Mediastinal lymph node sampling including levels 4R and 7.4. Tube thoracostomy x2 including a 19-French Blake and a 32-French chest tube.5. Multiple chest wall biopsies and excision of margin on anterior chest wall adjacent to adherent tumor.
ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia with double-lumen endotracheal tube.DISPOSITION OF SPECIMENS:  To pathology both for frozen and permanent analysis.FINDINGS: The right middle lobe tumor was adherent to the anterior chest wall. The adhesion was taken down, and the entire pleural surface along the edge of the adhesion was sent for pathologic analysis. The final frozen pathology on this entire area returned as negative for tumor. Additional chest wall abnormalities were biopsied and sent for pathologic analysis, and these all returned separately as negative for tumor and only fibrotic tissue. Several other biopsies were taken and sent for permanent analysis of the chest wall. All of the biopsy sites were additionally marked with Hemoclips. The right middle lobe lesion was accompanied with distal pneumonitis and otherwise no direct involvement of the right upper lobe or right lower lobe.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Less than 100 mL.CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AFTER SURGERY:  Stable.
HISTORY OF PROCEDURE: This patient is well known to our service. He was admitted the night before surgery and given hemodialysis and had close blood sugar monitoring in control. The patient was subsequently taken to the operating room on April 4, 2007, was given general anesthesia and was endotracheally intubated without incident. Although, he had markedly difficult airway, the patient had fiberoptic bronchoscopy performed all the way down to the level of the subsegmental bronchi. No abnormalities were noted in the entire tracheobronchial tree, and based on this, the decision was made to proceed with the surgery. The patient was kept in the supine position, and the single-lumen endotracheal tube was removed and a double-lumen tube was placed. Following this, the patient was placed into the left lateral decubitus position with the right side up and all pressure points were padded. Sterile DuraPrep preparation on the right chest was placed. A sterile drape around that was also placed. The table was flexed to open up the intercostal spaces. A second bronchoscopy was performed to confirm placement of the double-lumen endotracheal tube. Marcaine was infused into all incision areas prior to making an incision. The incisions for the VATS right middle lobectomy included a small 1-cm incision for the auscultatory incision approximately 4 cm inferior to the inferior tip of the scapula. The camera port was in the posterior axillary line in the eighth intercostal space through which a 5-mm 30-degree scope was used. Third incision was an anterior port, which was approximately 2 cm inferior to the inframammary crease and the midclavicular line in the anterior sixth intercostal space, and the third incision was a utility port, which was a 4 cm long incision, which was approximately one rib space below the superior pulmonary vein. All of these incisions were eventually created during the procedure. The initial incision was the camera port through which, under direct visualization, an additional small 5-mm port was created just inferior to the anterior port. These two ports were used to identify the chest wall lesions, which were initially thought to be metastatic lesions. Multiple biopsies of the chest wall lesions were taken, and the decision was made to also insert the auscultatory incision port. Through these three incisions, the initial working of the diagnostic portion of the chest wall lesion was performed. Multiple biopsies were taken of the entire chest wall offers and specimens came back as negative. The right middle lobe was noted to be adherent to the anterior chest wall. This area was taken down and the entire pleural surface along this area was taken down and sent for frozen pathologic analysis. This also returned as negative with only fibrotic tissue and a few lymphocytes within the fibrotic tissue, but no tumor cells. Based on this, the decision was made to not proceed with chest wall resection and continue with right middle lobectomy. Following this, the anterior port was increased in size and the utility port was made and meticulous dissection from an anterior to posterior direction was performed. The middle lobe branch of the right superior pulmonary vein was initially dissected and stapled with vascular load 45-mm EndoGIA stapler. Following division of the right superior pulmonary vein, the right middle lobe bronchus was easily identified. Initially, this was thought to be the main right middle lobe bronchus, but in fact it was the medial branch of the right middle lobe bronchus. This was encircled and divided with a blue load stapler with a 45-mm EndoGIA. Following division of this, the pulmonary artery was easily identified. Two branches of the pulmonary artery were noted to be going into the right middle lobe. These were individually divided with a vascular load after encircling with a right angle clamp. The vascular staple load completely divided these arterial branches successfully from the main pulmonary artery trunk, and following this, an additional branch of the bronchus was noted to be going to the right middle lobe. A fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed intraoperatively and confirmed that this was in fact the lateral branch of the right middle lobe bronchus. This was divided with a blue load stapler 45 mm EndoGIA. Following division of this, the minor and major fissures were completed along the edges of the right middle lobe separating the right upper lobe from the right middle lobe as well as the right middle lobe from the right lower lobe. Following complete division of the fissure, the lobe was put into an EndoGIA bag and taken out through the utility port. Following removal of the right middle lobe, a meticulous lymph node dissection sampling was performed excising the lymph node package in the 4R area as well as the 7 lymph node package. Node station 8 or 9 nodes were easily identified, therefore none were taken. The patient was allowed to ventilate under water on the right lung with no obvious air leaking noted. A 19-French Blake was placed into the posterior apical position and a 32-French chest tube was placed in the anteroapical position. Following this, the patient's lung was allowed to reexpand fully, and the patient was checked for air leaking once again. Following this, all the ports were closed with 2-0 Vicryl suture used for the deeper tissue, and 3-0 Vicryl suture was used to reapproximate the subcutaneous tissue and 4-0 Monocryl suture was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion. The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Right heart catheterization. Refractory CHF to maximum medical therapy.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Right heart catheterization.INDICATION:  Refractory CHF to maximum medical therapy.PROCEDURE:  After risks, benefits, and alternatives of the above-mentioned procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family in detail, informed consent was obtained both verbally and in writing. The patient was taken to Cardiac Catheterization Suite where the right internal jugular region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. 1% lidocaine solution was used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right internal jugular vein. Once adequate anesthesia has been obtained, a thin-walled #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right internal jugular vein. A steel guidewire was then inserted through the needle into the vessel without resistance. Small nick was then made in the skin and the needle was removed. An #8.5 French venous sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the vascular lumen without resistance. The guidewire and dilator were then removed. The sheath was then flushed. A Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted to 20 cm and the balloon was inflated. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the catheter was advanced into the right atrium through the right ventricle and into the pulmonary artery wedge position. Hemodynamics were measured along the way. Pulmonary artery saturation was obtained. The Swan was then kept in place for the patient to be transferred to the ICU for further medical titration. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient returned to the cardiac catheterization holding area in stable and satisfactory condition.FINDINGS: Body surface area equals 2.04, hemoglobin equals 9.3, O2 is at 2 liters nasal cannula. Pulmonary artery saturation equals 37.8. Pulse oximetry on 2 liters nasal cannula equals 93%. Right atrial pressure is 8, right ventricular pressure equals 59/9, pulmonary artery pressure equals 61/31 with mean of 43, pulmonary artery wedge pressure equals 21, cardiac output equals 3.3 by the Fick method, cardiac index is 1.6 by the Fick method, systemic vascular resistance equals 1821, and transpulmonic gradient equals 22.IMPRESSION: Exam and Swan findings consistent with low perfusion given that the mixed venous O2 is only 38% on current medical therapy as well as elevated right-sided filling pressures and a high systemic vascular resistance.
PLAN:  Given that the patient is unable to tolerate vasodilator therapy secondary to significant orthostasis and the fact that the patient will not respond to oral titration at this point due to lack of cardiac reserve, the patient will need to be discharged home on Primacor. The patient is unable to continue with his dobutamine therapy secondary to nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. At this time, we will transfer the patient to the Intensive Care Unit for titration of the Primacor therapy. We will also increase his Lasix to 80 mg IV q.d. We will increase his amiodarone to 400 mg daily. We will also continue with his Coumadin therapy. As stated previously, we will discontinue vasodilator therapy starting with the Isordil.

The gated myocardial scan revealed mild apical and distal inferoseptal hypokinesis with ejection fraction of 55%.CONCLUSIONS: Study done at rest only revealed findings consistent with an inferior non-transmural scar of moderate size and moderate degree. The left ventricular systolic function is markedly improved with much better regional wall motion of all left ventricular segments when compared to previous study done on Month DD, YYYY. We cannot assess the presence of any reversible perfusion defects because no stress imaging was performed.

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PROCEDURES PERFORMED:1. Left heart catheterization.2. Bilateral selective coronary angiography.3. Left ventriculogram was not performed.INDICATION:  Non-ST elevation MI.PROCEDURE:  After risks, benefits, and alternatives of the above-mentioned procedure were explained in detail to the patient, informed consent was obtained both verbally and in writing. The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization suite where the right femoral region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. 1% lidocaine solution was used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right femoral artery. Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, a thin-walled #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery. A steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance. A small nick was then made in the skin. The pressure was held. The needle was removed over the guidewire. Next, a Judkins left #4 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire. The guidewire was removed. The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed. The ostium of the left main coronary artery was engaged. Using hand injections of nonionic contrast material, the left coronary system was evaluated in several different views. Once an adequate study had been performed, the catheter was removed from the ostium of the left main coronary artery and a steel guidewire was inserted through the catheter. The catheter was then removed over the guidewire.Next, a Judkins right #4 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire. The guidewire was removed. The catheter was connected to manifold and flushed. The catheter did slip into the left ventricle. During the rotation, the LVEDP was then measured. The ostium of the right coronary artery was then engaged. Using hand injections of nonionic contrast material, the right coronary system was evaluated in several different views. Once adequate study has been performed, the catheter was then removed. The sheath was lastly flushed for the final time.
FINDINGS:LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY:  The left main coronary artery is a moderate caliber vessel, which bifurcates into the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries. There is no evidence of any hemodynamically significant stenosis.LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY:  The LAD is a moderate caliber vessel, which is subtotaled in its mid portion for approximately 1.5 cm to 1 cm with subsequent TIMI-I flow distally. The distal portion was diffusely diseased. The proximal portion otherwise shows minor luminal irregularities. The first diagonal branch demonstrated minor luminal irregularities throughout.CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY: The circumflex is a moderate caliber vessel, which traverses through the atrioventricular groove. There is a 60% proximal lesion and a 90% mid lesion prior to the takeoff of the first obtuse marginal branch. The first obtuse marginal branch demonstrates minor luminal irregularities throughout.RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY:  The RCA is a moderate caliber vessel, which demonstrates a 90% mid stenotic lesion. The dominant coronary artery gives off the posterior descending artery and posterolateral artery. The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was approximately 22 mmHg. It should be noted that during injection of the contrast agent that there was ST elevation in the inferior leads, which resolved after the injection was complete.
IMPRESSION:1. Three-vessel coronary artery disease involving a subtotaled left anterior descending artery with TIMI-I flow distally and 90% circumflex lesion and 90% right coronary artery lesion.2. Mildly elevated left-sided filling pressures.PLAN:1. The patient will be transferred to Providence Hospital today for likely PCI of the mid LAD lesion with a surgical evaluation for a coronary artery bypass grafting. These findings and plan were discussed in detail with the patient and the patient's family. The patient is agreeable.2. The patient will be continued on aggressive medical therapy including beta-blocker, aspirin, ACE inhibitor, and statin therapy. The patient will not be placed on Plavix secondary to the possibility for coronary bypass grafting. In light of the patient's history of cranial aneurysmal bleed, the patient will be held off of Lovenox and Integrilin.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:1. Hemoptysis.2. History of lung cancer.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tumor occluding right middle lobe with friability.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy, diagnostic.LOCATION:  Endoscopy suite #4.
ANESTHESIA: General per Anesthesia Service.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Minimal.COMPLICATIONS:  None.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  The patient presented to ABCD Hospital with a known history of lung cancer and acute hemoptysis with associated chest pain. Due to her prior history, it was felt that she would benefit from diagnostic fiberoptic bronchoscopy to help determine the etiology of the hemoptysis. She was brought to endoscopy suite #4 and informed consent was obtained. PROCEDURE DETAILS: The patient was placed in the supine position and intubated by the Anesthesia Service. Intravenous sedation was given as per Anesthesia. The fiberoptic scope was passed through the #8 endotracheal tube into the main trachea. The right mainstem bronchus was examined. The right upper lobe and subsegments appeared grossly within normal limits with no endobronchial lesions noted. Upon examining the right middle lobe, there was a tumor noted occluding the lateral segment of the right middle lobe and a clot appreciated over the medial segment of the right middle lobe.
The clot was lavaged with normal saline and there was noted to be tumor behind this clot. Tumor completely occluded both segments of the right middle lobe. Scope was then passed to the subsegments of the right lower lobe, which were individually examined and noted to be grossly free of endobronchial lesions. Scope was pulled back to the level of the midtrachea, passed into the left mainstem bronchus. Left upper lobe and its subsegments were examined and noted to be grossly free of endobronchial lesions. The lingula and left lower subsegments were all each individually examined and noted to be grossly free of endobronchial lesions. There were some secretions noted throughout the left lung. The scope was retracted and passed again to the right mainstem bronchus. The area of the right middle lobe was reexamined. The tumor was noted to be grossly friable with oozing noted from the tumor with minimal manipulation. It did not appear as if a scope or cannula could be passed distal to the tumor. Due to continued oozing, 1 cc of epinephrine was applied topically with adequate hemostasis obtained. The area was examined for approximately one minute for assurance of adequate hemostasis. The scope was then retracted and the patient was sent to the recovery room in stable condition. She will be extubated as per the Anesthesia Service. Cytology and cultures were not sent due to the patient's known diagnosis. Further recommendations are pending at this time.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Empyema.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Empyema.PROCEDURE PERFORMED:1. Right thoracotomy, total decortication.2. Intraoperative bronchoscopy.ANESTHESIA:  General.
COMPLICATIONS:  None.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 300 cc.FLUIDS:  2600 cc IV crystalloid.URINE:  300 cc intraoperatively.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 46-year-old Caucasian male who was admitted to ABCD Hospital since 08/14/03 with acute diagnosis of right pleural effusion. A thoracostomy tube was placed at the bedside with only partial resolution of the pleural effusion. On CT scan evaluation, there is evidence of an entrapped right lower lobe with loculations. Decision was made to proceed with surgical intervention for a complete decortication and the patient understands the need for surgery and signed the preoperative informed consent.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed in the supine position under general anesthesia per Anesthesia Department. Intraoperative bronchoscopy was performed by Dr. Y and evaluation of carina, left upper and lower lobes with segmental evidence of diffuse mucous, thick secretions which were thoroughly lavaged with sterile saline lavage. Samples were obtained from both the left and the right subbronchiole segments for Gram stain cultures and ASP evaluation. The right bronchus lower, middle, and upper were also examined and subsegmental bronchiole areas were thoroughly examined with no evidence of masses, lesions, or suspicious extrinsic compressions on the bronchi. At this point, all mucous secretions were thoroughly irrigated and aspirated until the airways were clear. Bronchoscope was then removed. Vital signs remained stable throughout this portion of the procedure. The patient was re-intubated by Anesthesia with a double lumen endotracheal tube. At this point, the patient was repositioned in the left lateral decubitus position with protection of all pressure points and the table was extended in customary fashion. At this point, the right chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The chest tube was removed before prepping the patient and the prior thoracostomy site was cleansed thoroughly with Betadine. The first port was placed through this incision intrathoracically. A bronchoscope was placed for inspection of the intrathoracic cavity. Pictures were taken. There is extensive fibrinous exudate noted under parietal and visceral pleura, encompassing the lung surface, diaphragm, and the posterolateral aspect of the right thorax. At this point, a second port site anteriorly was placed under direct visualization. With the aid of the thoracoscopic view, a Yankauer resection device was placed in the thorax and blunt decortication was performed and aspiration of reminder of the pleural fluid. Due to the gelatinous nature of the fibrinous exudate, there were areas of right upper lobe that adhered to the chest wall and the middle and lower lobes appeared entrapped. Due to the extensive nature of the disease, decision was made to open the chest in a formal right thoracotomy fashion. Incision was made. The subcutaneous tissues were then electrocauterized down to the level of the latissimus dorsi, which was separated with electrocautery down to the anterior 6th rib space. The chest cavity was entered with the right lung deflated per Anesthesia at our request. Once the intrathoracic cavity was accessed, a thorough decortication was performed in meticulous systematic fashion starting with the right upper lobe, middle, and the right lower lobe. With the expansion of the lung and reduction of the pleural surface fibrinous extubate, warm irrigation was used and the lungs allowed to re-expand. There was no evidence of gross leakage or bleeding at the conclusion of surgery.Full lung re-expansion was noted upon re-inflation of the lung. Two #32 French thoracostomy tubes were placed, one anteriorly straight and one posteriorly on the diaphragmatic sulcus. The chest tubes were secured in place with #0-silk sutures and placed on Pneumovac suction. Next, the ribs were reapproximated with five interrupted CTX sutures and latissimus dorsi was then reapproximated with a running #2-0 Vicryl suture. Next, subcutaneous skin was closed sequentially with a cosmetic layered subcutaneous closure. Steri-Strips were applied along with sterile occlusive dressings. The patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and extubated in the operating room. The chest tubes were maintained on Pleur-Evac suction for full re-expansion of the lung. The patient was transported to the recovery with vital signs stable. Stat portable chest x-ray is pending. The patient will be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring overnight.

White blood cell count 13.7, hemoglobin and hematocrit 9.6 and 29.9 respectively, and platelets 294,000. Differential of the white count 34% lymphocytes, 55% neutrophils.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 22-month-old girl, who has an infiltrate on the x-ray, hypoxemia, and presented in respiratory distress. I believe, she has bacterial pneumonia, which is partially treated by her amoxicillin, which is a failure of her outpatient treatment. She will be placed on the pneumonia pathway and started on cefuroxime to broaden her coverage. She is being admitted for hypoxemia. I hope that this will resolve overnight, and she will be discharged in the morning. I will start her home medications of Pulmicort twice daily and albuterol on a p.r.n. basis; however, at this point, she has no wheezing, so no systemic steroids will be instituted.Further interventions will depend on the clinical course.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Aortic valve replacement using a mechanical valve and two-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure using saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal artery and left radial artery graft to the left anterior descending artery.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
DIAGNOSIS:  Aortic valve stenosis with coronary artery disease associated with congestive heart failure. The patient has diabetes and is morbidly obese.PROCEDURES:  Aortic valve replacement using a mechanical valve and two-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure using saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal artery and left radial artery graft to the left anterior descending artery.ANESTHESIA:  General endotrachealINCISION:  Median sternotomyINDICATIONS:  The patient presented with severe congestive heart failure associated with the patient's severe diabetes. The patient was found to have moderately stenotic aortic valve. In addition, The patient had significant coronary artery disease consisting of a chronically occluded right coronary artery but a very important large obtuse marginal artery coming off as the main circumflex system. The patient also has a left anterior descending artery which has moderate disease and this supplies quite a bit of collateral to the patient's right system. It was decided to perform a valve replacement as well as coronary artery bypass grafting procedure.
FINDINGS:  The left ventricle is certainly hypertrophied· The aortic valve leaflet is calcified and a severe restrictive leaflet motion. It is a tricuspid type of valve. The coronary artery consists of a large left anterior descending artery which is associated with 60% stenosis but a large obtuse marginal artery which has a tight proximal stenosis.The radial artery was used for the left anterior descending artery. Flow was excellent. Looking at the targets in the posterior descending artery territory, there did not appear to be any large branches. On the angiogram these vessels appeared to be quite small. Because this is a chronically occluded vessel and the patient has limited conduit due to the patient's massive obesity, attempt to bypass to this area was not undertaken. The patient was brought to the operating roomPROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position. A median sternotomy incision was carried out and conduits were taken from the left arm as well as the right thigh. The patient weighs nearly three hundred pounds. There was concern as to taking down the left internal mammary artery. Because the radial artery appeared to be a good conduit The patient would have arterial graft to the left anterior descending artery territory. The patient was cannulated after the aorta and atrium were exposed and full heparinization.The patient went on cardiopulmonary bypass and the aortic cross-clamp was applied Cardioplegia was delivered through the coronary sinuses in a retrograde manner. The patient was cooled to 32 degrees. Iced slush was applied to the heart. The aortic valve was then exposed through the aortic root by transverse incision. The valve leaflets were removed and the #23 St. Jude mechanical valve was secured into position by circumferential pledgeted sutures. At this point, aortotomy was closed.The first obtuse marginal artery was a very large target and the vein graft to this target indeed produced an excellent amount of flow. Proximal anastomosis was then carried out to the foot of the aorta. The left anterior descending artery does not have severe disease but is also a very good target and the radial artery was anastomosed to this target in an end-to-side manner. The two proximal anastomoses were then carried out to the root of the aorta.
The patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass after aortic cross-clamp was released. The patient was adequately warmed. Protamine was given without adverse effect. Sternal closure was then done using wires. The subcutaneous layers were closed using Vicryl suture. The skin was approximated using staples.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Nuclear cardiac stress report. Recurrent angina pectoris in a patient with documented ischemic heart disease and underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
NUCLEAR CARDIOLOGY/CARDIAC STRESS REPORTINDICATION FOR STUDY:  Recurrent angina pectoris in a patient with documented ischemic heart disease and underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy.PROCEDURE:  The patient was studied in the resting state following intravenous delivery of adenosine triphosphate at 140 mcg/kg/min delivered over a total of 4 minutes. At completion of the second minute of infusion, the patient received technetium Cardiolite per protocol. During this interval, the blood pressure 150/86 dropped to near 136/80 and returned to near 166/84 at completion. No diagnostic electrocardiographic abnormalities were elaborated during this study.REGIONAL MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION WITH ADENOSINE PROVOCATION:  Scintigraphic study reveals at this time multiple fixed defects in perfusion suggesting indeed multivessel coronary artery disease, yet no active ischemia at this time. A fixed defect is seen in the high anterolateral segment. A further fixed perfusion defect is seen in the inferoapical wall extending from close to the septum. There is no evidence for active ischemia in either distribution. Lateral wall moving towards the apex of the left ventricle is further involved from midway through the ventricle moving upward and into the high anterolateral vicinity. When viewed from the vertical projection, the high septal wall is preserved with significant loss of the mid anteroapical wall moving to the apex and in a wraparound fashion in the inferoapical wall. A limited segment of apical myocardium is still viable.No gated wall motion study was obtained.
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiolite perfusion findings support multivessel coronary artery disease and likely previous multivessel infarct as has been elaborated above. There is no indication for active ischemia at this time.

PCI to the left circumflex with a 3.5 x 12 and a 3.5 x 8 mm Vision bare-metal stents postdilated with a 3.75-mm noncompliant balloon x2.PROCEDURE:  After all risks and benefits were explained to the patient, informed consent was obtained. The patient was brought to the cardiac cath suite. Right groin was prepped in usual sterile fashion. Right common femoral artery was cannulated with the modified Seldinger technique. A 6-French sheath was introduced. Next, Judkins right catheter was used to engage the right coronary artery and cineangiography was recorded in multiple views. Next, an EBU 3.5 guide was used to engage the left coronary system. Cineangiography was recorded in several views and it was noted to have a 99% proximal left circumflex stenosis. Angiomax bolus and drip were started after checking an ACT, which was 180, and an Universal wire was advanced through the left circumflex beyond the lesion. Next, a 3.0 x 12 mm balloon was used to pre-dilate the lesion. Next a 3.5 x 12 mm Vision bare-metal stent was advanced to the area of stenosis and deployed at 12 atmospheres. There was noted to be a plaque shift proximally at the edge of the stent. Therefore, a 3.5 x 8 mm Vision bare-metal stent was advanced to cover the proximal margin of the first stent and deployed at 12 atmospheres. Next, a 3.75 x 13 mm noncompliant balloon was advanced into the margin of the stent and two inflations at 20 atmospheres were done for 20 seconds. Final images showed excellent results with initial 99% stenosis reduced to 0%. The patient continues to have residual stenosis in the mid to distal in the OM branch. At this point, wire was removed. Final images confirmed initial stent results, no evidence of dissection, perforation, or complications.
Next, an angled pigtail catheter was advanced into the left ventricular cavity. LV pressure was measured. LV gram was done in both the LAO and RAO projections and a pullback gradient across the aortic valve was done and recorded. Finally, all guides were removed. Right femoral artery access site was imaged and Angio-Seal deployed to attain excellent hemostasis. The patient tolerated the procedure very well without complications.DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS1. Left main: Left main is a large-caliber vessel bifurcating in LAD and left circumflex with no significant disease.2. The LAD: LAD is a large-caliber vessel, wraps around the apex, gives off multiple septal perforators, three small-to-medium caliber diagonal branches without any significant disease.3. Left circumflex: Left circumflex is a large-caliber vessel, gives off a large distal PDA branch, has a 99% proximal lesion, 50% mid vessel lesion, and a 50% lesion in the OM, which is a distal branch.4. Right coronary artery: Right coronary artery is a moderate-caliber vessel, dominant, bifurcates into PDA and PLV branches, has only mild disease. Otherwise, no significant stenosis noted.5. LV: The LVEF 50%. Inferolateral wall hypokinesis. No significant mitral regurgitation. No gradient across the aortic valve on pullback.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  ST-elevation myocardial infarction with a 99% stenosis of the proximal portion of the left circumflex treated with a 3.5 x 12 mm Vision bare-metal stent and a 3.5 x 8 mm Vision bare-metal stent. Excellent results, 0% residual stenosis. The patient continues to have some residual 50% stenosis in the left circumflex system, some mild disease throughout the other vessels. Therefore, we will aggressively treat this patient medically with close followup as an outpatient.

Left subclavian access under fluoroscopic guidance.2. Left subclavian venogram under fluoroscopic evaluation.3. Insertion of ventricular lead through left subclavian approach and ventricular lead is Boston Scientific Dextrose model 12345, serial number 123456.
4. Insertion of single-chamber pacemaker implantation, Altrua, serial number 123456.5. Closure of the pocket after formation of pocket for pacemaker.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The procedure was explained to the patient with risks and benefits. The patient agreed and signed the consent form. The patient was brought to the cath lab, draped and prepped in the usual sterile fashion, received 1.5 mg of versed and 25 mg of Benadryl for conscious sedation.Access to the right subclavian was successful after the second attempt. The first attempt accessed the left subclavian artery. The needle was removed and manual compression applied for five minutes followed by re-accessing the subclavian vein successfully. The J-wire was introduced into the left subclavian vein.The anterior wall chest was anesthetized with lidocaine 2%, 2-inch incision using a #10 blade was used.The pocket was formed using blunt dissection as he was using the Bovie cautery for hemostasis. The patient went asystole during the procedure. The transcutaneous pacer was used. The patient was oxygenating well. The patient had several compression applied by the nurse. However, her own rhythm resolved spontaneously and the percutaneous pacer was kept on standby.
After that, the J-wire was tunneled into the pocket and then used to put the #7-French sheath into the left subclavian vein. The lead from the Boston Scientific Dextrose model 12345, serial number 12345 was inserted through the left subclavian to the right atrium; however, it was difficult to really enter the right ventricle; and while the lead was in place, the side port of the sheath was used to inject 15 mL of contrast to assess the subclavian and the right atrium. The findings were showing different anatomy, may be consistent with persistent left superior vena cava, and the angle to the right ventricle was different. At that point, the lead stylet was reshaped and was able to cross the tricuspid valve in a position consistent with the mid septal place.At that point, the lead was actively fixated. The stylet was removed. The R-wave measured at 40 millivolts. The impedance was 580 and the threshold was 1.3 volt. The numbers were accepted and because of the patient's fragility and the different anatomy noticed in the right atrium, concern about putting a second lead with re-access of the subclavian was high. I decided to proceed with a single-chamber pacemaker as a backup system.After that, the lead sleeve was used to actively fixate the lead in the anterior chest with two Ethibond sutures in the usual fashion.The lead was attached to the pacemaker in the header. The pacemaker was single-chamber pacemaker Altura 60, serial number 123456. After that, the pacemaker was put in the pocket. Pocket was irrigated with normal saline and was closed into two layers, deep interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and surface as continuous #4-0 Vicryl continuous.The pacemaker was programmed as VVI 60, and with history is 10 to 50 beats per minute. The lead position will be evaluated with chest x-ray.
No significant bleeding noticed.CONCLUSION: Successful single-chamber pacemaker implantation with left subclavian approach and venogram to assess the subclavian access site and the right atrial or right ventricle with asystole that resolved spontaneously during the procedure. No significant bleed.

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Aortoiliac occlusive disease.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Aortoiliac occlusive disease.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Aortobifemoral bypass.OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  The patient was taken to the operating room. The abdominal contents were within normal limits. The aorta was of normal size and consistency consistent with arteriosclerosis. A 16x8 mm Gore-Tex graft was placed without difficulty. The femoral vessels were small somewhat thin and there was posterior packing, but satisfactory bypass was performed.PROCEDURE:  The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in a supine position, and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner with Betadine solution. A longitudinal incision was made after a Betadine-coated drape was placed over the incisional area. Longitudinal incision was made over each groin initially and carried down to the subcutaneous fat and fascia. Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery. The common deep and superficial femoral arteries were exposed and then these incisions were covered with antibiotic soaked sponges. Attention was then turned to the abdomen, where a longitudinal incision was made from the pubis xiphoid, carried down subcutaneous fat and fascia. Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery. The abdomen was entered above the umbilicus and then this was extended with care inferiorly as the patient has undergone previous abdominal surgery. Mild adhesions were lysed. The omentum was freed. The small and large intestine were run with no evidence of abnormalities. The liver and gallbladder were within normal limits. No abnormalities were noted. At this point, the Bookwalter retractor was placed. NG tube was placed in the stomach and placed on suction. The intestines were gently packed intraabdominally and laterally. The rest of the peritoneum was then opened. The aorta was cleared, both proximally and distally. The left iliac was completely occluded. The right iliac was to be cleansed. At this point, 5000 units of aqueous heparin was administered to allow take effect. The aorta was then clamped below the renal arteries and opened in a longitudinal fashion. A single lumbar was ligated with #3-0 Prolene. The inferior mesenteric artery was occluded intraluminally and required no suture closure. Care was taken to preserve collaterals. The aorta was measured, and a 16 mm Gore-Tex graft was brought on the field and anastomosed to the proximal aorta using #3-0 Prolene in a running fashion. Last stitch was tied. Hemostasis was excellent. The clamp was gradually removed and additional Prolene was placed in the right posterolateral aspect to obtain better hemostasis. At this point, strong pulses were present within the graft. The limbs were vented and irrigated. Using bimanual technique, the retroperitoneal tunnels were developed immediately on top of the iliac arteries into the groin. The grafts were then brought through these, care being taken to avoid twisting of the graft. At this point, the right iliac was then ligated using #0 Vicryl and the clamp was removed. Hemostasis was excellent. The right common femoral artery was then clamped proximally and distally, opened with #11 blade extended with Potts scissors. The graft was _____ and anastomosed to the artery using #5-0 Prolene in a continuous fashion with a stitch _______ running fashion. Prior to tying the last stitch, the graft and artery were vented and the last stitch was tied. Flow was initially restored proximally then distally with good results. Attention was then turned to the left groin and the artery grafts were likewise exposed, cleared proximally and distally. The artery was opened, extended with a Potts scissors and anastomosis was performed with #5-0 Prolene again with satisfactory hemostasis. The last stitch was tied. Strong pulses were present within the artery and graft itself. At this point, 25 mg of protamine was administered. The wounds were irrigated with antibiotic solution. The groins were repacked. Attention was then returned to the abdomen. The retroperitoneal area and the anastomotic sites were checked for bleeding and none was present. The shell of the aorta was closed over the proximal anastomosis and the retroperitoneum was then repaired over the remaining portions of the graft. The intraabdominal contents were then allowed to resume their normal position. There was no evidence of ischemia to the large or small bowel. At this point, the omentum and stomach were repositioned. The abdominal wall was closed in a running single layer fashion using #1 PDS. The skin was closed with skin staples. The groins were again irrigated, closed with #3-0 Vicryl and #4-0 undyed Vicryl and Steri-Strips. The patient was then taken into the recovery room in satisfactory condition after tolerating the procedure well. Sponges and instrument counts were correct. Estimated blood loss 900 cc.

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
REASON FOR CONSULT:  I was asked to see this patient with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, on hospice with inferior ST-elevation MI.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient from prior strokes has expressive aphasia, is not able to express herself in a clear meaningful fashion. Her daughter who accompanies her is very attentive whom I had met previously during drainage of a malignant hemorrhagic pericardial effusion last month. The patient has been feeling well for the last several weeks, per the daughter, but today per the personal aide, became agitated and uncomfortable at about 2:30 p.m. At about 7 p.m., the patient began vomiting, was noted to be short of breath by her daughter with garbled speech, arms flopping, and irregular head movements. Her daughter called 911 and her symptoms seemed to improve. Then, she began vomiting. When the patient's daughter asked her if she had chest pain, the patient said yes.She came to the emergency room, an EKG showed inferior ST-elevation MI. I was called immediately and knowing her history, especially, her hospice status with recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, I felt thrombolytic was contraindicated and she would not be a candidate for aggressive interventional therapy with PCI/CABG. She was begun after discussion with the oncologist, on heparin drip and has received morphine, nitro, and beta-blocker, and currently states that she is pain free. Repeat EKG shows normalization of her ST elevation in the inferior leads as well as normalization of prior reciprocal changes.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. In early-to-mid December, she had an admission and was found to have a malignant pericardial effusion with tamponade requiring urgent drainage. We did repeat an echo several weeks later and that did not show any recurrence of the pericardial effusion. She is on hospice from the medical history, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, history of multiple CVA.MEDICATIONS:  Medications as an outpatient:1. Amiodarone 200 mg once a day.
2. Roxanol concentrate 5 mg three hours p.r.n. pain.ALLERGIES: CODEINE. NO SHRIMP, SEAFOOD, OR DYE ALLERGY.FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for cardiac disease.SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke cigarettes. She uses alcohol. No use of illicit drugs. She is divorced and lives with her daughter. She is a retired medical librarian from Florida.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Unable to be obtained due to the patient's aphasia.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Height 5 feet 3, weight of 106 pounds, temperature 97.1 degrees, blood pressure ranges from 138/82 to 111/87, pulse 61, respiratory rate 22. O2 saturation 100%. On general exam, she is an elderly woman with now marked aphasia, which per her daughter waxes and wanes, was more pronounced and she nods her head up and down when she says the word, no, and conversely, she nods her head side-to-side when she uses the word yes with some discordance in her head gestures with vocalization. HEENT shows the cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic. She has dry mucosal membrane. She now has a right facial droop, which per her daughter is new. Neck veins are not distended. No carotid bruits visible. Skin: Warm, well perfused. Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly. No wheezes. Cardiac exam: S1, S2, regular rate. No significant murmurs. PMI is nondisplaced. Abdomen: Soft, nondistended. Extremities: Without edema, on limited exam. Neurological exam seems to show only the right facial droop.DIAGNOSTIC/LABORATORY DATA:  EKGs as reviewed above. Her last ECG shows normalization of prior ST elevation in the inferior leads with Q waves and first-degree AV block, PR interval 280 milliseconds. Further lab shows sodium 135, potassium 4.2, chloride 98, bicarbonate 26, BUN 9, creatinine 0.8, glucose 162, troponin 0.17, INR 1.27, white blood cell count 1.3, hematocrit 31, platelet count of 179.Chest x-ray, no significant pericardial effusion.IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 69-year-old woman with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with a recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, now admitted with cerebrovascular accident and transient inferior myocardial infarction, which appears to be canalized. I will discuss this in detail with the patient and her daughter, and clearly, her situation is quite guarded with likely poor prognosis, which they are understanding of.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. I think it is reasonable to continue heparin, but clearly she would be at risk for hemorrhagic pericardial effusion recurrence.
2. Morphine is appropriate, especially for preload reduction and other comfort measures as appropriate.3. Would avoid other blood thinners including Plavix, Integrilin, and certainly, she is not a candidate for a thrombolytic with which the patient and her daughter are in agreement with after a long discussion.Other management as per the medical service. I have discussed the case with Dr. X of the hospitalist service who will be admitting the patient.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Bronchiolitis, respiratory syncytial virus positive; improved and stable. Innocent heart murmur, stable.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
DIAGNOSES:1. Bronchiolitis, respiratory syncytial virus positive; improved and stable.2. Innocent heart murmur, stable.HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for an acute onset of congestion. She was checked for RSV, which was positive and admitted to the hospital for acute bronchiolitis. She has always been stable on room air; however, because of her age and her early diagnosis, she was admitted for observation as RSV bronchiolitis typically worsens the third and fourth day of illness. She was treated per pathway orders. However, on the second day of admission, the patient was not quite eating well and parents live far away and she did have a little bit of trouble on first night of admission. There was a heart murmur that was heard that sounded innocent, but yet there was no chest x-ray that was obtained. We did obtain a chest x-ray, which did show a slight perihilar infiltrate in the right upper lobe. However, the rest of the lungs were normal and the heart was also normal. There were no complications during her hospitalization and she continued to be stable and eating better. On day 2 of the admission, it was decided she was okay to go home. Mother was advised regarding signs and symptoms of increased respiratory distress, which includes tachypnea, increased retractions, grunting, nasal flaring etc. and she was very comfortable looking for this. During her hospitalization, albuterol MDI was given to the patient and more for mom to learn outpatient care. The patient did receive a couple of doses, but she did not have any significant respiratory distress and she was discharged in improved condition.DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:VITAL SIGNS: She is afebrile. Vital signs were stable within normal limits on room air.GENERAL: She is sleeping and in no acute distress.HEENT: Her anterior fontanelle was soft and flat. She does have some upper airway congestion.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm with a 2-3/6 systolic murmur that radiates to bilateral axilla and the back.EXTREMITIES: Her femoral pulses were 2+ and her extremities were warm and well perfused with good capillary refill.LUNGS: Her lungs did show some slight coarseness, but good air movement with equal breath sounds. She does not have any wheezes at this time, but she does have a few scattered crackles at bilateral bases. She did not have any respiratory distress while she was asleep.ABDOMEN: Normal bowel sounds. Soft and nondistended.GENITOURINARY: She is Tanner I female.DISCHARGE WEIGHT: Her weight at discharge 3.346 kg, which is up 6 grams from admission.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  ACTIVITY: No one should smoke near The patient. She should also avoid all other exposures to smoke such as from fireplaces and barbecues. She is to avoid contact with other infants since she is sick and they are to limit travel. There should be frequent hand washings.
DIET: Regular diet. Continue breast-feeding as much as possible and encourage oral intake.MEDICATIONS: She will be sent home on albuterol MDI to be used as needed for cough, wheezes or dyspnea.ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Mom is quite comfortable with bulb suctioning the nose with saline and they know that they are to return immediately if she starts having difficulty breathing, if she stops breathing or she decides that she does not want to eat.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," The patient is a 4-month-old who presented with supraventricular tachycardia and persistent cyanosis.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
HISTORY:  The patient is a 4-month-old who presented today with supraventricular tachycardia and persistent cyanosis. The patient is a product of a term pregnancy that was uncomplicated and no perinatal issues are raised. Parents; however, did note the patient to be quite dusky since the time of her birth; however, were reassured by the pediatrician that this was normal. The patient demonstrates good interval weight gain and only today presented to an outside hospital with significant duskiness, some irritability, and rapid heart rate. Parents do state that she does appear to breathe rapidly, tires somewhat with the feeding with increased respiratory effort and diaphoresis. The patient is exclusively breast fed and feeding approximately 2 hours. Upon arrival at Children's Hospital, the patient was found to be in a narrow complex tachycardia with the rate in excess of 258 beats per minute with a successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm with adenosine. The electrocardiogram following the cardioversion had demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with a right atrial enlargement, northwest axis, and poor R-wave progression, possible right ventricular hypertrophy.FAMILY HISTORY: Family history is remarkable for an older sibling found to have a small ventricular septal defect that is spontaneously closed.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  A complete review of systems including neurologic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary are otherwise negative.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:GENERAL: Physical examination that showed a sedated, acyanotic infant who is in no acute distress.VITAL SIGNS: Heart rate of 170, respiratory rate of 65, saturation, it is nasal cannula oxygen of 74% with a prostaglandin infusion at 0.5 mcg/kg/minute.HEENT: Normocephalic with no bruit detected. She had symmetric shallow breath sounds clear to auscultation. She had full symmetrical pulses.
HEART: There is normoactive precordium without a thrill. There is normal S1, single loud S2, and a 2/6 continuous shunt type of murmur could be appreciated at the left upper sternal border.ABDOMEN: Soft. Liver edge is palpated at 3 cm below the costal margin and no masses or bruits detected.X-RAYS: Review of the chest x-ray demonstrated a normal situs, normal heart size, and adequate pulmonary vascular markings. There is a prominent thymus. An echocardiogram demonstrated significant cyanotic congenital heart disease consisting of normal situs, a left superior vena cava draining into the left atrium, a criss-cross heart with atrioventricular discordance of the right atrium draining through the mitral valve into the left-sided morphologic left ventricle. The left atrium drained through the tricuspid valve into a right-sided morphologic right ventricle. There is a large inlet ventricular septal defect as pulmonary atresia. The aorta was malopposed arising from the right ventricle in the anterior position with the left aortic arch. There was a small vertical ductus as a sole source of pulmonary artery blood flow. The central pulmonary arteries appeared confluent although small measuring 3 mm in the diameter. Biventricular function is well maintained.FINAL IMPRESSION:  The patient has significant cyanotic congenital heart disease physiologically with a single ventricle physiology and ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow and the incidental supraventricular tachycardia now in the sinus rhythm with adequate ventricular function. The saturations are now also adequate on prostaglandin E1.RECOMMENDATION:  My recommendation is that the patient be continued on prostaglandin E1. The patient's case was presented to the cardiothoracic surgical consultant, Dr. X. The patient will require further echocardiographic study in the morning to further delineate the pulmonary artery anatomy and confirm the central confluence. A consideration will be made for diagnostic cardiac catheterization to fully delineate the pulmonary artery anatomy prior to surgical intervention. The patient will require some form of systemic to pulmonary shunt, modified pelvic shunt or central shunt as a durable source of pulmonary blood flow. Further surgical repair was continued on the size and location of the ventricular septal defect over the course of the time for consideration of possible Rastelli procedure. The current recommendation is for proceeding with a central shunt and followed then by bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunt with then consideration for a septation when the patient is 1 to 2 years of age. These findings and recommendations were reviewed with the parents via a Spanish interpreter.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Left muscle sparing mini thoracotomy with left upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Intercostal nerve block for postoperative pain relief at five levels.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Non-small-cell carcinoma of the left upper lobe.2. History of lymphoma in remission.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Non-small-cell carcinoma of the left upper lobe.2. History of lymphoma in remission.PROCEDURE:  Left muscle sparing mini thoracotomy with left upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Intercostal nerve block for postoperative pain relief at five levels.
INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE:  This is an 84-year-old lady who was referred by Dr. A for treatment of her left upper lobe carcinoma. The patient has a history of lymphoma and is in remission. An enlarged right axillary lymph node was biopsied recently and was negative for lymphoma. A mass in the left upper lobe was biopsied with fine-needle aspiration and shown to be a primary non-small-cell carcinoma of the lung. PET scan was, otherwise, negative for spread and resection was advised. All the risk and benefits were fully explained to the patient and she elected to proceed as planned. She was transferred to rehab for couple of weeks to buildup strength before the surgery.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: In the operating room under anesthesia, she was prepped and draped suitably. Dr. B was the staff anesthesiologist. Left muscle sparing mini thoracotomy was made. The serratus and latissimus muscles were not cut but moved out to the way. Access to the chest was obtained through the fifth intercostal space. Two Tuffier retractors of right angles provided adequate exposure.The inferior pulmonary ligament was not dissected free and lymph nodes from the station 9 were now sent for pathology. The parietal pleural reflexion around the hilum was now circumcised, and lymph nodes were taken from station 8 and station 5.The branches of the pulmonary artery to the upper lobe were now individually stapled with a 30/2.5 staple gun or/and the smaller one were ligated with 2-0 silk. The left superior pulmonary vein was transected using a TA30/2.5 staple gun, and the fissure was completed using firings of an endo-GIA 60/4.8 staple gun. Finally, the left upper lobe bronchus was transected using a TA30/4.8 staple gun. Please note, that this patient had been somewhat unusual variant of a small bronchus that was coming out posterior to the main trunk of the pulmonary artery and supplying a small section of the posterior portion of the left upper lobe.The specimen was delivered and sent to pathology. The mass was clearly palpable in the upper portion of the lingular portion of this left upper lobe. Frozen section showed that the margin was negative.
The chest was irrigated with warm sterile water and when the left lower lobe inflated, there was no air leak. A single 32-French chest tube was inserted, and intercostal block was done with Marcaine infiltrated two spaces above and two spaces below thus achieving a block at five levels 30 mL of Marcaine was used all together. A #2 Vicryl pericostal sutures were now applied. The serratus and latissimus muscles retracted back in place. A #19 French Blake drain placed in the subcutaneous tissues and 2-0 Vicryl used for the fat followed by 4-0 Monocryl for the skin. The patient was transferred to the ICU in a stable condition.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," A critically ill 67-year-old with multiple medical problems probably still showing signs of volume depletion with hypotension and atrial flutter with difficult to control rate.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Hospitalist followup is required for continuing issues with atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, which was resistant to treatment with diltiazem and amiodarone, being followed by Dr. X of cardiology through most of the day. This afternoon, when I am seeing the patient, nursing informs me that rate has finally been controlled with esmolol, but systolic blood pressures have dropped to the 70s with a MAP of 52. Dr. X was again consulted from the bedside. We agreed to try fluid boluses and then to consider Neo-Synephrine pressure support if this is not successful. In addition, over the last 24 hours, extensive discussions have been held with the family and questions answered by nursing staff concerning the patient's possible move to Tahoe Pacific or a long-term acute care. Other issues requiring following up today are elevated transaminases, continuing fever, pneumonia, resolving adult respiratory distress syndrome, ventilatory-dependent respiratory failure, hypokalemia, non-ST-elevation MI, hypernatremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, BPH, atrial flutter, inferior vena cava filter, and diabetes.PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONVITAL SIGNS: T-max 103.2, blood pressure at this point is running in the 70s/mid 40s with a MAP of 52, heart rate is 100.GENERAL: The patient is much more alert appearing than my last examination of approximately 3 weeks ago. He denies any pain, appears to have intact mentation, and is in no apparent distress.EYES: Pupils round, reactive to light, anicteric with external ocular motions intact.CARDIOVASCULAR: Reveals an irregularly irregular rhythm.LUNGS: Have diminished breath sounds but are clear anteriorly.ABDOMEN: Somewhat distended but with no guarding, rebound, or obvious tenderness to palpation.EXTREMITIES: Show trace edema with no clubbing or cyanosis.
NEUROLOGICAL: The patient is moving all extremities without focal neurological deficits.LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 149; this is down from 151 yesterday. Potassium 3.9, chloride 114, bicarb 25, BUN 35, creatinine 1.5 up from 1.2 yesterday, hemoglobin 12.4, hematocrit 36.3, WBC 16.5, platelets 231,000. INR 1.4. Transaminases are continuing to trend upwards of SGOT 546, SGPT 256. Also noted is a scant amount of very concentrated appearing urine in the bag.IMPRESSION:  Overall impressions continues to be critically ill 67-year-old with multiple medical problems probably still showing signs of volume depletion with hypotension and atrial flutter with difficult to control rate.PLAN1. Hypotension. I would aggressively try and fluid replete the patient giving him another liter of fluids. If this does not work as discussed with Dr. X, we will start some Neo-Synephrine, but also continue with aggressive fluid repletion as I do think that indications are that with diminished and concentrated urine that he may still be down and fluids will still be required even if pressure support is started.2. Increased transaminases. Presumably this is from increased congestion. This is certainly concerning. We will continue to follow this. Ultrasound of the liver was apparently negative.3. Fever and elevated white count. The patient does have a history of pneumonia and empyema. We will continue current antibiotics per infectious disease and continue to follow the patient's white count. He is not exceptionally toxic appearing at this time. Indeed, he does look improved from my last examination.
4. Ventilatory-dependent respiratory failure. The patient has received a tracheostomy since my last examination. Vent management per PMA.5. Hypokalemia. This has resolved. Continue supplementation.6. Hypernatremia. This is improving somewhat. I am hoping that with increased fluids this will continue to do so.7. Diabetes mellitus. Fingerstick blood glucoses are reviewed and are at target. We will continue current management. This is a critically ill patient with multiorgan dysfunction and signs of worsening renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular function with extremely guarded prognosis. Total critical care time spent today 37 minutes.

TITLE OF OPERATION:  Ligation (clip interruption) of patent ductus arteriosus.INDICATION FOR SURGERY:  This premature baby with operative weight of 600 grams and evidence of persistent pulmonary over circulation and failure to thrive has been diagnosed with a large patent ductus arteriosus originating in the left-sided aortic arch. She has now been put forward for operative intervention.PREOP DIAGNOSIS: 1. Patent ductus arteriosus.2. Severe prematurity.3. Operative weight less than 4 kg (600 grams).COMPLICATIONS:  None.
FINDINGS:  Large patent ductus arteriosus with evidence of pulmonary over circulation. After completion of the procedure, left recurrent laryngeal nerve visualized and preserved. Substantial rise in diastolic blood pressure.DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  After obtaining information consent, the patient was positioned in the neonatal intensive care unit, cribbed in the right lateral decubitus, and general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. The left chest was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and a posterolateral thoracotomy incision was performed. Dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the second intercostal space was entered freely with no damage to the underlying lung parenchyma. The lung was quite edematous and was retracted anteriorly exposing the area of the isthmus. The pleura overlying the ductus arteriosus was inside and the duct dissected in a nearly circumferential fashion. It was then test occluded and then interrupted with a medium titanium clip. There was preserved pulsatile flow in the descending aorta. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified and preserved. With excellent hemostasis, the intercostal space was closed with 4-0 Vicryl sutures and the muscular planes were reapproximated with 5-0 Caprosyn running suture in two layers. The skin was closed with a running 6-0 Caprosyn suture. A sterile dressing was placed. Sponge and needle counts were correct times 2 at the end of the procedure. The patient was returned to the supine position in which palpable bilateral femoral pulses were noted.I was the surgical attending present in the neonatal intensive care unit and in-charge of the surgical procedure throughout the entire length of the case.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Laparoscopic lysis of adhesions and Laparoscopic left adrenalectomy. Left adrenal mass, 5.5 cm and intraabdominal adhesions.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left adrenal mass, 5.5 cm.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Left adrenal mass, 5.5 cm.2. Intraabdominal adhesions.PROCEDURE PERFORMED:1. Laparoscopic lysis of adhesions.2. Laparoscopic left adrenalectomy.
ANESTHESIA:  General.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 100 cc.FLUIDS:  3500 cc crystalloids.DRAINS: None.DISPOSITION: The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition. Sponge, needle, and instrument counts were correct per OR staff.
HISTORY: This is a 57-year-old female who was found to have a large left adrenal mass, approximately 5.5 cm in size. She had undergone workup previously with my associate, Dr. X as well as by Endocrinology, and showed this to be a nonfunctioning mass. Due to the size, the patient was advised to undergo an adrenalectomy and she chose the laparoscopic approach due to her multiple pulmonary comorbidities.INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:  Showed multiple intraabdominal adhesions in the anterior abdominal wall. The spleen and liver were unremarkable. The gallbladder was surgically absent.There was large amount of omentum and bowel in the pelvis, therefore the gynecological organs were not visualized. There was no evidence of peritoneal studding or masses. The stomach was well decompressed as well as the bladder.PROCEDURE DETAILS:  After informed consent was obtained from the patient, she was taken to the operating room and given general anesthesia. She was placed on a bean bag and secured to the table. The table was rotated to the right to allow gravity to aid in our retraction of the bowel.Prep was performed. Sterile drapes were applied. Using the Hassan technique, we placed a primary laparoscopy port approximately 3 cm lateral to the umbilicus on the left. Laparoscopy was performed with ___________. At this point, we had a second trocar, which was 10 mm to 11 mm port. Using the non-cutting trocar in the anterior axillary line and using Harmonic scalpel, we did massive lysis of adhesions from the anterior abdominal wall from the length of the prior abdominal incision, the entire length of the abdominal incision from the xiphoid process to the umbilicus. The adhesions were taken down off the entire anterior abdominal wall.
At this point, secondary and tertiary ports were placed. We had one near the midline in the subcostal region and to the left midline and one at the midclavicular line, which were also 10 and 11 ports using a non-cutting blade.At this point, using the Harmonic scalpel, we opened the white line of Toldt on the left and reflected the colon medially, off the anterior aspect of the Gerota's fascia. Blunt and sharp dissection was used to isolate the upper pole of the kidney, taking down some adhesions from the spleen. The colon was further mobilized medially again using gravity to aid in our retraction. After isolating the upper pole of the kidney using blunt and sharp dissection as well as the Harmonic scalpel, we were able to dissect the plane between the upper pole of the kidney and lower aspect of the adrenal gland. We were able to isolate the adrenal vein, dumping into the renal vein, this was doubly clipped and transected. There was also noted to be vascular structure of the upper pole, which was also doubly clipped and transected. Using the Harmonic scalpel, we were able to continue free the remainder of the adrenal glands from its attachments medially, posteriorly, cephalad, and laterally.At this point, using the EndoCatch bag, we removed the adrenal gland through the primary port in the periumbilical region and sent the flap for analysis. Repeat laparoscopy showed no additional findings. The bowel was unremarkable, no evidence of bowel injury, no evidence of any bleeding from the operative site.The operative site was irrigated copiously with saline and reinspected and again there was no evidence of bleeding. The abdominal cavity was desufflated and was reinspected. There was no evidence of bleeding.At this point, the camera was switched to one of the subcostal ports and the primary port in the periumbilical region was closed under direct vision using #0 Vicryl suture. At this point, each of the other ports were removed and then with palpation of each of these ports, this indicated that the non-cutting ports did close and there was no evidence of fascial defects.
At this point, the procedure was terminated. The abdominal cavity was desufflated as stated. The patient was sent to Recovery in stable condition. Postoperative orders were written. The procedure was discussed with the patient's family at length.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," A 51-year-old male with chest pain and history of coronary artery disease.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
A 51-year-old male with chest pain and history of coronary artery disease.COMPARISON: None.MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 5mg IV at 0920 hours.HEART RATE: Recorded heart rate 55 to 57bpm.EXAM:Initial unenhanced axial CT imaging of the heart was obtained with ECG gating for the purpose of coronary artery calcium scoring (Agatston Method) and calcium volume determination.
18 gauge IV Intracath was inserted into the right antecubital vein.A 20cc saline bolus was injected intravenously to confirm vein patency and adequacy of venous access.Multi-detector CT imaging was performed with a 64 slice MDCT scanner with images obtained from the mid ascending aorta to the diaphragm at 0.5mm slice thickness during breath-holding.95 cc of Isovue was administered followed by a 90cc saline bolus chaser. Image reconstruction was performed using retrospective cardiac gating. Calcium scoring analysis (Agatston Method and volume determination) was performed.FINDINGS:CALCIUM SCORE: The patient's total Agatston calcium score is: 115. The Agatston score for the individual vessels are: LM: 49. RCA: 1. LAD: 2. CX: 2. Other: 62. The Agatston calcium score places the patient in the 90th percentile, which means 10 percent of the male population in this age group would have a higher calcium score.
QUALITY ASSESSMENT: Examination is of good quality with good bolus timing and good demonstration of coronary arteries.LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY: The left main coronary artery has a posteriorly positioned take-off from the valve cusp, with a patent ostium, and it has an extramural (non-malignant) course. The vessel is of moderate size. There is an apparent second ostium, in a more normal anatomic location, but quite small. This has an extramural (non-malignant) course. There is mixed calcific/atheromatous plaque within the distal vessel, as well as positive remodeling. There is no high grade stenosis but a flow-limiting lesion can not be excluded. The vessel trifurcates into a left anterior descending artery, a ramus intermedius and a left circumflex artery.LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING CORONARY ARTERY: The left anterior descending artery is a moderate-size vessel, with ostial calcific plaque and soft plaque without a high-grade stenosis, but there may be a flow-limiting lesion here. There is a moderate size bifurcating first diagonal branch with ostial calcification, but no flow-limiting lesion. LAD continues as a moderate-size vessel to the posterior apex of the left ventricle.Ramus intermedius branch is a moderate to large-size vessel with extensive calcific plaque, but no ostial stenosis. The dense calcific plaque limits evaluation of the vessel lumen, and a flow-limiting lesion within the proximal vessel cannot be excluded. The vessel continues as a small vessel on the left lateral ventricular wall.LEFT CIRCUMFLEX CORONARY ARTERY: The left circumflex artery is a moderate-size vessel with a normal ostium giving rise to a small OM1 branch and a large OM2 branch supplying much of the posterolateral wall of the left ventricular. The AV-groove branch tapers at the base of the heart. There is minimal calcific plaque within the mid vessel, but there is no flow-limiting stenosis.
RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY: The right coronary artery is a large vessel with a normal ostium giving rise to a moderate-size acute marginal branch and continuing as a large vessel to the crux of the heart supplying a left posterior descending artery and small posterolateral ventricular branches. There is minimal calcific plaque within the mid vessel, but there is no flow-limiting lesion.Coronary circulation is right dominant.FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS: End diastolic volume: 106ml End systolic volume: 44ml Ejection fraction: 58 percentANATOMIC ANALYSIS:Normal heart size with no demonstrated ventricular wall abnormalities. There are no demonstrated myocardial
bridges. Normal left atrial appendage with no evidence of thrombosis.Cardiac valves are normal.The aortic diameter measures 33mm just distal to the sino-tubular junction. The visualized thoracic aorta appears normal in size.Normal pericardium without pericardial thickening or effusion.There is no demonstrated mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. The visualized lung parenchyma is unremarkable.
There are two left and two right pulmonary veins.IMPRESSION:Ventricular function: Normal.Single vessel coronary artery analysis:LM: There is a posterior origin from the valve cusp. There is mixed calcific/atheromatous plaque and positive remodeling plaque within the LM, and although there is no high grade stenosis, a flow-limiting lesion can not be excluded. In addition, there is an apparent second ostium of indeterminate significance, but both ostia have extramural (non-malignant) courses.LAD: Dense calcific plaque within the proximal vessel with ostial calcification and possible flow-limiting proximal lesion. There is a ramus branch with dense calcific plaque limiting evaluation of the vessel lumen, but a flow-limiting lesion cannot be excluded here.CX: Minimal calcific plaque with no flow-limiting lesion.RCA: Minimal calcific plaque with no flow-limiting lesion.Coronary artery dominance: Right.

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Insertion of right subclavian central venous catheter.SECOND ANESTHESIA:  Approximately 10 cc of 1% lidocaine.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Minimal.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 74-year-old white female who presents to ABCD General Hospital after falling down flight of eleven stairs and sustained numerous injuries. The patient went to OR today for an I&D of left lower extremity degloving injury. Orthopedics was planning on taking the patient back for serial debridements and need for reliable IV access is requested.PROCEDURE:  Informed consent was obtained by the patient and her daughter. All risks and benefits of the procedure were explained and all questions were answered. The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion. After landmarks were identified, approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine were injected into the skin and subcuticular tissues and the right neck posterior head of the sternocleidomastoid. Locator needle was used to correctly cannulate the right internal jugular vein. Multiple attempts were made and the right internal jugular vein was unable to be cannulized.
Therefore, we prepared for a right subclavian approach. The angle of the clavicle was found and a #22 gauge needle was used to anesthetize approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine in skin and subcuticular tissues along with the periosteum of the clavicle. A Cook catheter needle was then placed and ________ the clavicle in the orientation aimed toward the sternal notch. The right subclavian vein was then accessed. A guidewire was placed with a Cook needle and then the needle was subsequently removed and a #11 blade scalpel was used to nick the skin. A dilator sheath was placed over the guidewire and subsequently removed. The triple lumen catheter was then placed over the guidewire and advanced to 14 cm. All ports aspirated and flushed. Good blood return was noted and all ports were flushed well. The triple lumen catheter was then secured at 14 cm using #0 silk suture. A sterile dressing was then applied. A stat portable chest x-ray was ordered to check line placement. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.

Documented coronary artery disease with previous angioplasty and stent in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex artery, last procedure in 2005.3. Primary malignant ventricular arrhythmia and necessitated ventricular fibrillation. He is intubated and ventilated.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Acute coronary artery syndrome with ST segment elevation in anterior wall distribution. Primary ventricular arrhythmia. Occluded left anterior descending artery, successfully re-canalized with angioplasty and implantation of the drug-eluting stent. Previously stented circumflex with mild stenosis and previously documented occlusion of the right coronary artery, well collateralized.PROCEDURES: Left heart catheterization, selective bilateral coronary angiography and left ventriculography. Revascularization of the left anterior descending with angioplasty and implantation of a drug-eluting stent. Right heart catheterization and Swan-Ganz catheter placement for monitoring.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient arrived from the emergency room intubated and ventilated. He is hemodynamically stable on heparin and Integrilin bolus and infusion was initiated. The right femoral area was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Lidocaine 2 mL was then filled locally. The right femoral artery was cannulated with an 18-guage needle followed by a 6-French vascular sheath. A guiding catheter XB 3.5 was advanced in manipulated to cannulate the left coronary artery and angiography was obtained. A confirmed occlusion of the left anterior descending artery with minimal collaterals and also occlusion of the right coronary artery, which is well collateralized. An angioplasty wire with present wire was advanced into the left anterior descending artery, and could cross the area of occlusion within the stent. An angioplasty balloon measuring 2.0 x 15 was advanced and three inflations were obtained. It successfully re-canalized the artery. There is evidence of residual stenosis within the distal aspect of the previous stents. A drug-eluting stent Xience 2.75 x 15 was advanced and positioned within the area of stenosis with its distal marker adjacent to bifurcation with a diagonal branch and was deployed at 12 and 18 atmospheres. The intermittent result was improved. An additional inflation was obtained more proximally. His blood pressure fluctuated and dropped in the 70s, correlating with additional sedation. There is patency of the left anterior descending artery and good antegrade flow. The guiding catheter was replaced with a 5-French Judkins right catheter manipulated to cannulate the right coronary artery and selective angiography was obtained. The catheter was then advanced into the left ventricle and pressure measurement was obtained including pullback across the aortic valve. The right femoral vein was cannulated with an 18-guage needle followed by an 8-French vascular sheath. A 8-French Swan-Ganz catheter was then advanced under fluoroscopic and hemodynamic control and pressure stenting was obtained from the right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary capillary wedge position. Cardiac catheter was determined by thermal dilution. The procedure was then concluded, well tolerated and without complications. The vascular sheath was in secured in place and the patient return to the coronary care unit for further monitoring. Fluoroscopy time was 8.2 minutes. Total amount of contrast was 113 mL.
HEMODYNAMICS: The patient remained in sinus rhythm with intermittent ventricular bigeminy post revascularization. His initial blood pressure was 96/70 with a mean of 83 and the left ventricular pressure was 17 mmHg. There was no gradient across the aortic valve. Closing pressure was 97/68 with a mean of 82.Right heart catheterization with right atrial pressure at 13, right ventricle 31/9, pulmonary artery 33/19 with a mean of 25, and capillary wedge pressure of 19. Cardiac output was 5.87 by thermal dilution.CORONARIES: On fluoroscopy, there was evidence of previous coronary stent in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex distribution.A. Left main coronary: The left main coronary artery is of good caliber and has no evidence of obstructive lesions.B. Left anterior descending artery: The left anterior descending artery was initially occluded within the previously stented proximal-to-mid segment. There is minimal collateral flow.C. Circumflex: Circumflex is a nondominant circulation. It supplies a first obtuse marginal branch on good caliber. There is an outline of the stent in the midportion, which has mild 30% stenosis. The rest of the vessel has no significant obstructive lesions. It also supplies significant collaterals supplying the occluded right coronary artery.D. Right coronary artery: The right coronary artery is a weekly dominant circulation. The vessel is occluded in intermittent portion and has a minimal collateral flow distally.
ANGIOPLASTY:  The left anterior descending artery was the site of re-canalization by angioplasty and implantation of a drug-eluting stent (Xience 15 mm length deployed at 2.9 mm) final result is good with patency of the left anterior descending artery, good antegrade flow and no evidence of dissection. The stent was deployed proximal to the bifurcation with a second diagonal branch, which has remained patent. There is a septal branch overlapped by the stent, which is also patent, although presenting a proximal stenosis. The distal left anterior descending artery trifurcates with two diagonal branches and apical left anterior descending artery. There is good antegrade flow and no evidence of distal embolization.CONCLUSION:  Acute coronary artery syndrome with ST-segment elevation in anterior wall distribution, complicated with primary ventricular malignant arrhythmia and required defibrillation along intubation and ventilatory support.Previously documented coronary artery disease with remote angioplasty and stents in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex artery.Acute coronary artery syndrome with ST-segment elevation in anterior wall distribution related to in-stent thrombosis of the left anterior descending artery, successfully re-canalized with angioplasty and a drug-eluting stent. There is mild-to-moderate disease of the previously stented circumflex and clinic occlusion of the right coronary artery, well collateralized.Right femoral arterial and venous vascular access.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Repair of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, ligation of patent ductus arteriosus, repair secundum type atrial septal defect (autologous pericardial patch), subtotal thymectomy, and insertion of peritoneal dialysis catheter.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
TITLE OF OPERATION:1. Repair of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection.2. Ligation of patent ductus arteriosus.3. Repair secundum type atrial septal defect (autologous pericardial patch).4. Subtotal thymectomy.5. Insertion of peritoneal dialysis catheter.INDICATION FOR SURGERY:  This neonatal was diagnosed postnatally with total anomalous pulmonary venous connection. Following initial stabilization, she was transferred to the Hospital for complete correction.PREOP DIAGNOSIS: 
1. Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection.2. Atrial septal defect.3. Patent ductus arteriosus.4. Operative weight less than 4 kilograms (3.2 kilograms).COMPLICATIONS:  None.CROSS-CLAMP TIME:  63 minutes.CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS TIME MONITOR: 35 minutes, profound hypothermic circulatory arrest time (4 plus 19) equals 23 minutes. Low flow perfusion 32 minutes.
FINDINGS: Horizontal pulmonary venous confluence with right upper and middle with two veins entering the confluence on the right and multiple entry sites for left-sided veins. Large patulous anastomosis between posterior aspect of the left atrium and anterior aspect of the pulmonary venous confluence. Nonobstructed ascending vein ligated. Patent ductus arteriosus diminutive left atrium with posterior atrial septal defect with deficient inferior margin. At completion of the procedure, right ventricular pressure approximating one-half of systemic, normal sinus rhythm, good biventricular function by visual inspection.PROCEDURE:  After the informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating room table in supine position. Upon induction of general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of indwelling arterial and venous monitoring lines. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion from chin to groins. A median sternotomy incision was performed. Dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the sternum was scored and divided with an oscillating saw. A subtotal thymectomy was performed. Systemic heparinization was achieved and the pericardium was entered and fashioned until cradle. A small portion of the anterior pericardium was procured and fixed in glutaraldehyde for patch closure of segment of the atrial septal defect during the procedure. Pursestrings were deployed on the ascending aorta on the right. Atrial appendage. The aorta was then cannulated with an 8-French aorta cannula and the right atrium with an 18-French Polystan right-angle cannula. With an ACT greater than 400, greater pulmonary bypass was commenced with excellent cardiac decompression and the patent ductus arteriosus was ligated with a 2-0 silk tie. Systemic cooling was started and the head was packed and iced and systemic steroids were administered. During cooling, traction suture was placed in the apex of the left ventricle. After 25 minutes of cooling, the aorta was cross-clamped and the heart arrested by administration of 30 cubic centimeter/kilogram of cold-blood cardioplegia delivered directly within the aortic root following the aorta cross-clamping. Following successful cardioplegic arrest, a period of low flow perfusion was started and a 10-French catheter was inserted into the right atrial appendage substituting the 18-French Polystan venous cannula. The heart was then rotated to the right side and the venous confluence was exposed. It was incised and enlarged and a corresponding incision in the dorsal and posterior aspect of the left atrium was performed. The two openings were then anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion with several interlocking sutures to avoid pursestring effect with a running 7-0 PDS suture. Following completion of the anastomosis, the heart was returned into the chest and the patient's blood volume was drained into the reservoir. A right atriotomy was then performed during the period of circulatory arrest. The atrial septal defect was very difficult to expose, but it was sealed with an autologous pericardial patch was secured in place with a running 6-0 Prolene suture. The usual deairing maneuvers were carried out and lining was administered and the right atriotomy was closed in two layers with a running 6-0 Prolene sutures. The venous cannula was reinserted. Cardiopulmonary bypass restarted and the aorta cross-clamp was released. The patient returned to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and started regaining satisfactory hemodynamics which, following a prolonged period of rewarming, allow for us to wean her from cardiopulmonary bypass successfully and moderate inotropic support and sinus rhythm. Modified ultrafiltration was carried out and two sets of atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed as well as the peritoneal dialysis catheter and two 15-French Blake drains. Venous decannulation was followed by aortic decannulation and administration of protamine sulfate. All cannulation sites were oversewn with 6-0 Prolene sutures and the anastomotic sites noticed to be hemostatic. With good hemodynamics and hemostasis, the sternum was then smeared with vancomycin, placing closure with stainless steel wires. The subcutaneous tissues were closed in layers with the reabsorbable monofilament sutures. Sponge and needle counts were correct times 2 at the end of the procedure. The patient was transferred in very stable condition to the pediatric intensive care unit .I was the surgical attending present in the operating room and in charge of the surgical procedure throughout the entire length of the case. Given the magnitude of the operation, the unavailability of an appropriate level, cardiac surgical resident, Mrs. X (attending pediatric cardiac surgery at the Hospital) participated during the cross-clamp time of the procedure in quality of first assistant.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Right upper lung lobectomy. Mediastinal lymph node dissection
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
OPERATION1. Right upper lung lobectomy.2. Mediastinal lymph node dissection.ANESTHESIA1. General endotracheal anesthesia with dual-lumen tube.2. Thoracic epidural.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room, and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered with a dual-lumen tube. Next, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, and his right chest was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion. We used a #10-blade scalpel to make an incision in the skin approximately 1 fingerbreadth below the angle of the scapula. Dissection was carried down in a muscle-sparing fashion using Bovie electrocautery. The 5th rib was counted, and the 6th interspace was entered. The lung was deflated. We identified the major fissure. We then began by freeing up the inferior pulmonary ligament, which was done with Bovie electrocautery. Next, we used Bovie electrocautery to dissect the pleura off the lung. The pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung were identified. Of note was the fact that there was a visible, approximately 4 x 4-cm mass in the right upper lobe of the lung without any other metastatic disease palpable. As mentioned, a combination of Bovie electrocautery and sharp dissection was used to identify the pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung. Next, we began by ligating the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung. This was done with suture ligature in combination with clips. After taking the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung, we used a combination of blunt dissection and sharp dissection with Metzenbaum scissors to separate out the pulmonary vein branch of the right upper lobe of the lung. This likewise was ligated with a 0 silk. It was stick-tied with a 2-0 silk. It was then divided. Next we dissected out the bronchial branch to the right upper lobe of the lung. A curved Glover was placed around the bronchus. Next a TA-30 stapler was fired across the bronchus. The bronchus was divided with a #10-blade scalpel. The specimen was handed off. We next performed a mediastinal lymph node dissection. Clips were applied to the base of the feeding vessels to the lymph nodes. We inspected for any signs of bleeding. There was minimal bleeding. We placed a #32-French anterior chest tube, and a #32-French posterior chest tube. The rib space was closed with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion. A flat Jackson-Pratt drain, #10 in size, was placed in the subcutaneous flap. The muscle layer was closed with a combination of 2-0 Vicryl followed by 2-0 Vicryl, followed by 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion. Sterile dressing was applied. The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU in good condition.

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: A 51-year-old, obese, white female with positive family history of coronary disease and history of chest radiation for Hodgkin disease 20 years ago with no other identifiable risk factors who presents with an acute myocardial infarction with elevated enzymes. The chest pain occurred early Tuesday morning. She was treated with Plavix, Lovenox, etc., and transferred for coronary angiography and possible PCI. The plan was discussed with the patient and all questions answered.PROCEDURE NOTE: Following sterile prep and drape, the right groin and instillation of 1% Xylocaine anesthesia, the right femoral artery was percutaneously entered with a single wall puncture. A 6-French sheath inserted. Selective left and right coronary injections performed using Judkins coronary catheters with a 6-French pigtail catheter used to obtain left ventricle pressures, and a left ventriculography. The left pullback pressure. The catheters withdrawn. Sheath injection. Hemostasis obtained with a 6-French Angio-Seal device. She tolerated the procedure well.Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure equals 25 mmHg post A wave. No aortic valve or systolic gradient on pullback.ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:I. Left coronary artery: The left main coronary artery isnormal. The left anterior descending extends to the apex and has only minor luminal irregularities within the midportion of the vessel. Normal diagonal branches. Normal septal perforator branches. The left circumflex is a nondominant vessel with only minor irregularities with normal obtuse marginal branches.II. Right coronary artery: The proximal right coronary artery has a focal calcification. There is minor plaque with luminal irregularity in the proximal and midportion of the vessel with no narrowing greater than 10 to 20% at most. The right coronary artery is a dominant system which gives off normal posterior
descending and posterior lateral branches. TIMI 3 flow is present.III. Left ventriculogram: The left ventricle is slightly enlarged with normal contraction of the base, but, with wall motion abnormality involving the anteroapical and inferoapical left ventricle with hypokinesis within the apical portion. Ejection fraction estimated 40%, 1+ mitral regurgitation (echocardiogram ordered).DISCUSSION: Recent inferoapical mild myocardial infarction by left ventriculography and cardiac enzymes with elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure post A wave, but, only minor residual coronary artery plaque with calcification proximal right coronary artery.PLAN: Medical treatment is contemplated, including ACE inhibitor, a beta blocker, aspirin, Plavix, nitrates.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Posterior mediastinal mass with possible neural foraminal involvement (benign nerve sheath tumor by frozen section). Left thoracotomy with resection of posterior mediastinal mass.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Posterior mediastinal mass with possible neural foraminal involvement.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Posterior mediastinal mass with possible neural foraminal involvement (benign nerve sheath tumor by frozen section).OPERATION PERFORMED: Left thoracotomy with resection of posterior mediastinal mass.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 23-year-old woman who recently presented with a posterior mediastinal mass and on CT and MRI there were some evidence of potential widening of one of the neural foramina. For this reason, Dr. X and I agreed to operate on this patient together. Please note that two surgeons were required for this case due to the complexity of it. The indications and risks of the procedure were explained and the patient gave her informed consent.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the operating suite and placed in the supine position. General endotracheal anesthesia was given with a double lumen tube. The patient was positioned for a left thoracotomy. All pressure points were carefully padded. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. A muscle sparing incision was created several centimeters anterior to the tip of the scapula. The serratus and latissimus muscles were retracted. The intercostal space was opened. We then created a thoracoscopy port inferiorly through which we placed a camera for lighting and for visualization. Through our small anterior thoracotomy and with the video-assisted scope placed inferiorly we had good visualization of the posterior mediastinum mass. This was in the upper portion of the mediastinum just posterior to the subclavian artery and aorta. The lung was deflated and allowed to retract anteriorly. With a combination of blunt and sharp dissection and with attention paid to hemostasis, we were able to completely resect the posterior mediastinal mass. We began by opening the tumor and taking a very wide large biopsy. This was sent for frozen section, which revealed a benign nerve sheath tumor. Then, using the occluder device Dr. X was able to _____ the inferior portions of the mass. This left the external surface of the mass much more malleable and easier to retract. Using a bipolar cautery and endoscopic scissors we were then able to completely resect it. Once the tumor was resected, it was then sent for permanent sections. The entire hemithorax was copiously irrigated and hemostasis was complete. In order to prevent any lymph leak, we used 2 cc of Evicel and sprayed this directly on to the raw surface of the pleural space. A single chest tube was inserted through our thoracoscopy port and tunneled up one interspace. The wounds were then closed in multiple layers. A #2 Vicryl was used to approximate the ribs. The muscles of the chest wall were allowed to return to their normal anatomic position. A 19 Blake was placed in the subcutaneous tissues. Subcutaneous tissues and skin were closed with running absorbable sutures. The patient was then rolled in the supine position where she was awakened from general endotracheal anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," A 49-year-old man with respiratory distress, history of coronary artery disease with prior myocardial infarctions, and recently admitted with pneumonia and respiratory failure.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:1. Respiratory arrest.2 . End-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.3. Coronary artery disease.4. History of hypertension.DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:1. Status post-respiratory arrest.2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.3. Congestive heart failure.
4. History of coronary artery disease.5. History of hypertension.SUMMARY: The patient is a 49-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital in respiratory distress, and had to be intubated shortly after admission to the emergency room. The patients past history is notable for a history of coronary artery disease with prior myocardial infarctions in 1995 and 1999. The patient has recently been admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient has been smoking up until three to four months previously. On the day of admission, the patient had the sudden onset of severe dyspnea and called an ambulance. The patient denied any gradual increase in wheezing, any increase in cough, any increase in chest pain, any increase in sputum prior to the onset of his sudden dyspnea.ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:GENERAL: Showed a well-developed, slightly obese man who was in extremis.NECK: Supple, with no jugular venous distension.HEART: Showed tachycardia without murmurs or gallops.PULMONARY: Status showed decreased breath sounds, but no clear-cut rales or wheezes.
EXTREMITIES: Free of edema.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Special Care Unit and intubated. He received intravenous antibiotic therapy with Levaquin. He received intravenous diuretic therapy. He received hand-held bronchodilator therapy. The patient also was given intravenous steroid therapy with Solu-Medrol. The patients course was one of gradual improvement, and after approximately three days, the patient was extubated. He continued to be quite dyspneic, with wheezes as well as basilar rales. After pulmonary consultation was obtained, the pulmonary consultant felt that the patients overall clinical picture suggested that he had asignificant element of congestive heart failure. With this, the patient was placed on increased doses of Lisinopril and Digoxin, with improvement of his respiratory status. On the day of discharge, the patient had minimal basilar rales; his chest also showed minimal expiratory wheezes; he had no edema; his heart rate was regular; his abdomen was soft; and his neck veins were not distended. It was, therefore, felt that the patient was stable for further management on an outpatient basis.DIAGNOSTIC DATA: The patients admission laboratory data was notable for his initial blood gas, which showed a pH of 7.02 with a pCO2 of 118 and a pO2 of 103. The patients electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST-T wave changes. The patents CBC showed a white count of 24,000, with 56% neutrophils and 3% bands.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: His diet was to be a 2 grams sodium, 1800 calorie ADA diet. His medications were to be Prednisone 20 mg twice per day, Theo-24 400 mg per day, Furosemide 40 mg 1-1/2 tabs p.o. per day; Acetazolamide 250 mg one p.o. per day, Lisinopril 20 mg. one p.o. twice per day, Digoxin 0.125 mg one p.o. q.d., nitroglycerin paste 1 inch h.s., K-Dur 60 mEq p.o. b.i.d. He was also to use a Ventolin inhaler every four hours as needed, and Azmacort four puffs twice per day. He was asked to return for follow-up with Dr. X in one to two weeks. Arrangements have been made for the patient to have an echocardiogram for further evaluation of his congestive heart failure later on the day of discharge.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Left heart catheterization, coronary angiography, left ventriculography. Severe complex left anterior descending and distal circumflex disease with borderline, probably moderate narrowing of a large obtuse marginal branch.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PROCEDURE:  Left heart catheterization, coronary angiography, left ventriculography.COMPLICATIONS:  None.PROCEDURE DETAIL:  The right femoral area was draped and prepped in the usual fashion after Xylocaine infiltration. A 6-French arterial sheath was placed in the usual fashion. Left and right coronary angiograms were then performed in various projections after heparin was given 2000 units intraaortic. The right coronary artery was difficult to cannulate because of its high anterior takeoff. This was nondominant. Several catheters were used. Ultimately, an AL1 diagnostic catheter was used. A pigtail catheter was advanced across the aortic valve. Left ventriculogram was then done in the RAO view using 30 mL of contrast. Pullback gradient was obtained across the aortic valve. Femoral angiogram was performed through the sheath which was above the bifurcation, was removed with a Perclose device with good results. There were no complications. He tolerated this procedure well and returned to his room in good condition.FINDINGS1. Right coronary artery: This has an unusual high anterior takeoff. The vessel is nondominant, has diffuse mild-to-moderate disease.2. Left main trunk: A 30% to 40% distal narrowing is present.3. Left anterior descending: Just at the ostium of the vessel and up to and including the bifurcation of the first large diagonal branch, there is 80 to 90% narrowing. The diagonal is a large vessel about 3 mm in size.
4. Circumflex: Dominant vessel, 50% narrowing at the origin of the obtuse marginal. After this, there is 40% narrowing in the AV trunk. The small posterior lateral branch has diffuse mild disease and then the vessel gives rise to a fairly large posterior ventricular branch, which has 70% ostial narrowing, and then after this the posterior descending has 80% narrowing at its origin.5. Left ventriculogram: Normal volume in diastole and systole. Normal systolic function is present. There is no mitral insufficiency or left ventricular outflow obstruction.DIAGNOSES1. Severe complex left anterior descending and distal circumflex disease with borderline, probably moderate narrowing of a large obtuse marginal branch. Dominant circumflex system. Severe disease of the posterior descending. Mild left main trunk disease.2. Normal left ventricular systolic function.Given the complex anatomy of the predominant problem which is the left anterior descending; given its ostial stenosis and involvement of the bifurcation of the diagonal, would recommend coronary bypass surgery. The patient also has severe disease of the circumflex which is dominant. This anatomy is not appropriate for percutaneous intervention. The case will be reviewed with a cardiac surgeon.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Bilateral pleural effusion. Removal of bilateral #32 French chest tubes with closure of wound.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral pleural effusion.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral pleural effusion.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Removal of bilateral #32-French chest tubes with closure of wound.COMPLICATIONS: None.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  The patient is a 66-year-old African-American male who has been in the intensive care unit for over a month with bilateral chest tubes for chronic draining pleural effusions with serous drainage. A decision was made to proceed with removal of these chest tubes and because of the fistulous tracts, this necessitated to close the wounds with sutures. The patient was agreeable to proceed.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was prepped and draped at the bedside over both chest tube sites. The pressures applied over the sites and the skin was closed with interrupted #3-0 Ethilon sutures. The skin was then cleansed and Vaseline occlusive dressing was applied over the sites. The same procedure was performed on the other side. The chest tubes were removed on full inspiration. Vital signs remained stable throughout the procedure. The patient will remain in the intensive care unit for continued monitoring.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta, dilated cardiomyopathy, bicuspid aortic valve, patent foramen ovale.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
HISTORY:  The patient is a 4-month-old who presented with respiratory distress and absent femoral pulses with subsequent evaluation including echocardiogram that demonstrated severe coarctation of the aorta with a peak gradient of 29 mmHg and associated dilated cardiomyopathy with fractional shortening of 16%. A bicuspid aortic valve was also seen without insufficiency or stenosis. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization for balloon angioplasty for coarctation of the aorta.PROCEDURE: After sedation and general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped. Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets. Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized. Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.Using a percutaneous technique a 4-French 8 cm long double lumen central venous catheter was inserted in the left femoral vein and sutured into place. There was good blood return from both the ports.Using a 4-French sheath a 4-French wedge catheter was inserted into the right femoral vein and advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch of pulmonary arteries. The atrial septum was not probe patent.Using a 4-French sheath a 4-French marker pigtail catheter was inserted into the left femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta ,ascending aorta and left ventricle. A descending aortogram demonstrated discrete coarctation of the aorta approximately 8 mm distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. The transverse arch measured 5 mm. Isthmus measured 4.7 mm and coarctation measured 2.9 x 1.8 mm at the descending aorta level. The diaphragm measured 5.6 mm. The pigtail catheter was exchanged for a wedge catheter, which was then directed into the right innominate artery. This catheter was exchanged over a wire for a Tyshak mini 6 x 2 cm balloon catheter which was advanced across the coarctation and inflated with complete disappearance of discrete waist. Pressure pull-back following angioplasty, however, demonstrated a residual of 15-20 mmHg gradient. Repeat angiogram showed mild improvement in degree of aortic narrowing. The angioplasty was then performed using a Tyshak mini 7 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of mild waist. The pigtail catheter was then reintroduced for a pressure pull-back measurement and final angiogram.
Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption.Cineangiograms were obtained with injection in the descending aorta.After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized. The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis. The patient was returned to the pediatric intensive care unit in satisfactory condition. There were no complications.DISCUSSION:  Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal. Mixed venous saturation was low due to mild systemic arterial desaturation and anemia. There is no evidence of significant intracardiac shunt. Further the heart was desaturated due to VQ mismatch.Phasic right-sided pressures were normal as was the right pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressure with the A-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 12 mmHg. Left ventricular systolic pressure was mildly increased with a 60 mmHg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and a 29 mmHg systolic gradient on pressure pull-back to the descending aorta. The calculated flows were mildly increased. Vascular resistances were normal. A cineangiogram with contrast injection in the descending aorta showed a normal left aortic arch with normal origins of the brachiocephalic vessels. There is discrete juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta. Flow within the intercostal arteries was retrograde. Following balloon angioplasty of coarctation of the aorta, there was slight fall in the mixed venous saturation and an increase in systemic arterial saturation as the fall in left ventricular systolic pressure from 99 mmHg to 92 mmHg. There remained a 4 mmHg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and 9 mmHg systolic gradient pressure pull-back to the descending aorta. The calculated systemic flow fell to normal values. Final angiogram with injection in the descending aorta demonstrated improved caliber of coarctation of the aorta with mild intimal irregularity and a small left lateral filling defect consistent with a small intimal tear in the region of the ductus arteriosus. There is brisk flow in the descending aorta and appropriate flow in the intercostal arteries. The narrowest diameter of the aorta measured 4.9 x 4.2 mm.
DIAGNOSES: 1. Juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta.2. Dilated cardiomyopathy.3. Bicuspid aortic valve.4. Patent foramen ovale.INTERVENTION:  Balloon dilation of coarctation of the aorta.MANAGEMENT:  The case will be discussed at combined Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery Case Conference. The patient will be allowed to recover from the current intervention with the hopes of complete left ventricular function recovery. The patient will undoubtedly require formal coarctation of the aorta repair surgically in 4-6 months. The further cardiologic care will be directed by Dr. X.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Aortogram with bilateral, segmental lower extremity run off. Left leg claudication. The patient presents with lower extremity claudication.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Left leg claudication.POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS:  Left leg claudication.OPERATION PERFORMED:  Aortogram with bilateral, segmental lower extremity run off.ANESTHESIA:  Conscious sedation.INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: The patient presents with lower extremity claudication. She is a 68-year-old woman, who is very fearful of the aforementioned procedures. Risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to her to include bleeding, infection, arterial trauma requiring surgery, access issues and recurrence. She appears to understand and agrees to proceed.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was taken to the Angio Suite, placed in a supine position. After adequate conscious sedation, both groins were prepped with Chloraseptic prep. Cloth towels and paper drapes were placed. Local anesthesia was administered in the common femoral artery and using ultrasound guidance, the common femoral artery was accessed. Guidewire was threaded followed by a 4-French sheath. Through the 4-French sheath a 4-French Omni flush catheter was placed. The glidewire was removed and contrast administered to identify the level of the renal artery. Using power injector an aortogram proceeded.The catheter was then pulled down to the aortic bifurcation. A timed run-off view of both legs was performed and due to a very abnormal and delayed run-off in the left, I opted to perform an angiogram of the left lower extremity with an isolated approach. The catheter was pulled down to the aortic bifurcation and using a glidewire, I obtained access to the contralateral left external iliac artery. The Omni flush catheter was advanced to the left distal external iliac artery. The glidewire rather exchanged for an Amplatz stiff wire. This was left in place and the 4-French sheath removed and replaced with a 6-French destination 45-cm sheath. This was advanced into the proximal superficial femoral artery and an angiogram performed. I identified a functionally occluded distal superficial femoral artery and after obtaining views of the run off made plans for angioplasty.The patient was given 5000 units of heparin and this was allowed to circulate. A glidewire was carefully advanced using Roadmapping techniques through the functionally occluded blood vessels. A 4-mm x 4-cm angioplasty balloon was used to dilate the area in question.Final views after dilatation revealed a dissection. A search for a 5-mm stent was performed, but none of this was available. For this reason, I used a 6-mm x 80-mm marked stent and placed this at the distal superficial femoral artery. Post dilatation was performed with a 4-mm angioplasty balloon. Further views of the left lower extremity showed irregular change in the popliteal artery. No significant stenosis could be identified in the left popliteal artery and noninvasive scan. For this reason, I chose not to treat any further areas in the left leg.I then performed closure of the right femoral artery with a 6-French Angio-Seal device. Attention was turned to the left femoral artery and local anesthesia administered. Access was obtained with the ultrasound and the femoral artery identified. Guidewire was threaded followed by a 4-French sheath. This was immediately exchanged for the 6-French destination sheath after the glidewire was used to access the distal external iliac artery. The glidewire was exchanged for the Amplatz stiff wire to place the destination sheath. The destination was placed in the proximal superficial femoral artery and angiogram obtained. Initial views had been obtained from the right femoral sheath before removal.
Views of the right superficial femoral artery demonstrated significant stenosis with accelerated velocities in the popliteal and superficial femoral artery. For this reason, I performed the angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery using the 4-mm balloon. A minimal dissection plane measuring less than 1 cm was identified at the proximal area of dilatation. No further significant abnormality was identified. To avoid placing a stent in the small vessel I left it alone and approached the popliteal artery. A 3-mm balloon was chosen to dilate a 50 to 79% popliteal artery stenosis. Reasonable use were obtained and possibly a 4-mm balloon could have been used. However, due to her propensity for dissection I opted not to. I then exchanged the glidewire for an O1 for Thruway guidewire using an exchange length. This was placed into the left posterior tibial artery. A 2-mm balloon was used to dilate the orifice of the posterior tibial artery. I then moved the wire to the perineal artery and dilated the proximal aspect of this vessel. Final images showed improved run-off to the right calf. The destination sheath was pulled back into the left external iliac artery and an Angio-Seal deployed.FINDINGS:  Aortogram demonstrates a dual right renal artery with the inferior renal artery supplying the lower one third of the right renal parenchyma. No evidence of renal artery stenosis is noted bilaterally. There is a single left renal artery. The infrarenal aorta, both common iliac and the external iliac arteries are normal. On the right, a superficial femoral artery is widely patent and normal proximally. At the distal third of the thigh there is diffuse disease with moderate stenosis noted. Moderate stenosis is also noted in the popliteal artery and single vessel run-off through the posterior tibial artery is noted. The perineal artery is functionally occluded at the midcalf. The dorsal pedal artery filled by collateral at the high ankle level.On the left, the proximal superficial femoral artery is patent. Again, at the distal third of the thigh, there is a functional occlusion of the superficial femoral artery with poor collateralization to the high popliteal artery. This was successfully treated with angioplasty and a stent placement. The popliteal artery is diffusely diseased without focal stenosis. The tibioperoneal trunk is patent and the anterior tibial artery occluded at its orifice.IMPRESSION1. Normal bilateral renal arteries with a small accessory right renal artery.2. Normal infrarenal aorta as well as normal bilateral common and external iliac arteries.
3. The proximal right renal artery is normal with moderately severe stenosis in the superficial femoral popliteal and tibial arteries. Successful angioplasty with reasonable results in the distal superficial femoral, popliteal and proximal posterior tibial artery as described.4. Normal proximal left superficial femoral artery with functional occlusion of the distal left superficial femoral artery successfully treated with angioplasty and stent placement. Run-off to the left lower extremity is via a patent perineal and posterior tibial artery.

OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:1. Redo coronary bypass grafting x3, right and left internal mammary, left anterior descending, reverse autogenous saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal and posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery. Total cardiopulmonary bypass, cold-blood potassium cardioplegia, antegrade for myocardial protection.2. Placement of a right femoral intraaortic balloon pump.DESCRIPTION:  The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. After adequate endotracheal anesthesia was induced, appropriate monitoring lines were placed. Chest, abdomen an legs were prepped and draped in sterile fashion. The femoral artery on the right was punctured and a guidewire was placed. The track was dilated and intraaortic balloon pump was placed in the appropriate position, sewn in place and ballooning started.The left greater saphenous vein was harvested from the groin to the knee and prepared by ligating all branches with 4-0 silk and flushed with vein solution. The leg was closed with running 3-0 Dexon subcu and running 4-0 Dexon on the skin.The old mediastinal incision was opened. The wires were cut and removed. The sternum was divided in the midline. Retrosternal attachments were taken down. The left internal mammary was dissected free from its takeoff at the left subclavian bifurcation at the diaphragm and surrounded with papaverine-soaked gauze. The heart was dissected free of its adhesions. The patient was fully heparinized and cannulated with a single aorta and single venous cannula. Retrograde cardioplegia cannula was attempted to be placed, but could not be fitted into the coronary sinus safely, therefore, it was banded and oversewn with 5-0 Prolene. An antegrade cardioplegia needle sump was placed and secured to the ascending aorta. Cardiopulmonary bypass ensued. The ascending aorta was cross clamped. Cold-blood potassium cardioplegia was given antegrade, a total of 10 cc/kg. It was followed by sumping the ascending aorta. The obtuse marginal was identified and opened and an end-to-side anastomosis was performed with a running 7-0 Prolene suture. The vein was cut to length. Antegrade cardioplegia was given, a total of 200 cc. The posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery was identified, opened and end-to-side anastomosis then performed with a running 7-0 Prolene suture. The vein was cut to length. Antegrade cardioplegia was given. The mammary was clipped distally, divided and spatulated for anastomosis. The anterior descending was identified, opened and end-to-side anastomosis then performed with running 8-0 Prolene suture and warm blood potassium cardioplegia was given. The cross clamp was removed. A partial-occlusion clamp was placed. Aortotomies were made. The vein was cut to fit these and sutured in place with running 5-0 Prolene suture. The partial-occlusion clamp was removed. All anastomoses were inspected and noted to be patent and dry. Atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed. The patient was fully warmed and ventilation was commenced. The patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass, ventricular balloon pumping and inotropic support and weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass. The patient was decannulated in routine fashion. Protamine was given. Good hemostasis was noted. A single mediastinal chest tube and bilateral pleural Blake drains were placed. The sternum was closed with figure-of-eight stainless steel wire. The linea alba was closed with figure-of-eight of #1 Vicryl, the sternal fascia closed with running #1 Vicryl, the subcu closed with running 2-0 Dexon, skin with running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular stitch. The patient tolerated the procedure well.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Large recurrent right pleural effusion.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Large recurrent right pleural effusion.PROCEDURE:1. Conscious sedation.2. Chest tube talc pleurodesis of the right chest.INDICATIONS:  The patient is a 65-year-old lady with a history of cirrhosis who has developed a recurrent large right pleural effusion. Chest catheter had been placed previously, and she had been draining up to 1.5 liters of serous fluid a day. Eventually, this has decreased and a talc pleurodesis is being done to see her pleural effusion does not recur.
SPECIMENS: None.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Zero.NARRATIVE: After obtaining informed consent from the patient and her daughter, the patient was assessed and found to be in good condition and a good candidate for conscious sedation. Vital signs were taken. These were stable, so the patient was then given initially 0.5 mg of Versed and 2 mg of morphine IV. After a couple of minutes, she was assessed and found to be awake but calm, so then the chest tube was clamped and then through the chest tube a solution of 120 mL of normal saline containing 5 g of talc and 40 mg of lidocaine were then put into her right chest taking care that no air would go in to create a pneumothorax. She was then laid on her left lateral decubitus position for 5 minutes and then turned into the right lateral decubitus position for 5 minutes and then the chest tube was unclamped. The patient was given additional 0.5 mg of Versed and 0.5 mg of Dilaudid IV achieving a state where the patient was comfortable but readily responsive. The patient tolerated the procedure well. She did complain of up to a 7/10 pain, but quickly this was brought under control. The chest tube was unclamped. Now, the patient will be left to rest and she will get a chest x-ray in the morning.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Cardiac evaluation and treatment in a patient who came in the hospital with abdominal pain.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
REASON FOR REFERRAL:  Cardiac evaluation and treatment in a patient who came in the hospital with abdominal pain.HISTORY: This is a 77-year-old white female patient whom I have known for the last about a year or so who has underlying multiple medical problems including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease status post aortocoronary bypass surgery about eight years ago at Halifax Medical Center where she had triple vessel bypass surgery with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the left circumflex and right coronary arteries. Since then, she has generally done well. She used to be seeing another cardiologist and apparently she had a stress test in September 2008 and she was otherwise cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography, but the patient declined to have one done and since then she has been on medical therapy.The patient had been on medical therapy at home and generally doing well. Recently, she had no leg swelling, undue exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She denies any rest or exertional chest discomfort. Yesterday evening, she had her dinner and she was sitting around and she felt discomfort in the chest at about 7:00 p.m. The discomfort was a crampy pain in the left lower quadrant area, which seemed to radiating to the center of the abdomen and to the right side and it was off and on lasting for a few minutes at a time and then subsiding. Later on she was nauseous, but she did not have any vomiting. She denied any diarrhea. No history of fever or chills. Since the pain seemed to persist, the patient came to the hospital emergency room at 11:35 p.m. where she was seen and admitted for the same. She was given morphine, Zofran, Demerol, another Zofran, and Reglan as well as Demerol again and she was given intravenous fluids. Subsequently, her pain finally went away and she does not have any pain since about 7:00 a.m. this morning. The patient was admitted however for further workup and treatment. At the time of my examination this afternoon, the patient is sitting, lying in bed and comfortable and has no abdominal pain of any kind. She has not been fed any food, however. The patient also had had pelvis and abdominal CT scan performed, which has been described to be partial small bowel obstruction, internal hernia, volvulus or adhesion most likely in the left flank area. The patient has had left nephrectomy and splenectomy, which has been described. A 1.5-mm solid mass is described to be in the lower pole of the kidney. The patient also has been described to have diverticulosis without diverticulitis on this finding.Currently however, the patient has no clinical symptoms according to her.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: She has had hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the last 15 years, diabetes mellitus for the last eight years, and coronary artery disease for last about eight years or so. She had a chest and back pain about eight years ago for about two weeks and then subsequently she was reported to be evaluated. She has a small myocardial infarction and then she was under the care of Dr. A and she had aortocoronary bypass surgery at Halifax Medical Center by Dr. B, which was a three-vessel bypass surgery with left internal mammary artery to the left descending artery and saphenous vein graft to the left circumflex and distal right coronary artery respectively.
She had had nuclear stress test with Dr. C on September 3, 2008, which was described to be abnormal with ischemic defects, but I do not think the patient had any further cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography after that. She has been treated medically.This patient also had an admission to this hospital in May 2008 also for partial small bowel obstruction and cholelithiasis and sigmoid diverticulosis. She was described to have had a hemorrhagic cyst of the right kidney. She has mild arthritis for the last 10 or 15 years. She has a history of GERD for the last 20 years, and she also has a history of peptic ulcer disease in the duodenum, but never had any bleeding. She has a history of diverticulosis as mentioned. No history of TIA or CVA. She has one kidney. She was in a car accident in 1978 and afterwards she had to have left nephrectomy as well as splenectomy because of rupture. The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism once about eight years ago after her aortocoronary bypass surgery. She describes this to be a clot on left lung. I am not sure if she had any long-term treatment, however.In the past, the patient had aortocoronary bypass surgery in 2003 and incisional hernia surgery in 1979 as well as hysterectomy in 1979 and she had splenectomy and nephrectomy as described in 1978.FAMILY HISTORY:  Her father died at age of 65 of massive heart attack and mother died at age of 62 of cancer. She had a one brother who died of massive heart attack in his 50s, a brother died at the age of 47 of cancer, and another brother died in his 60s of possible rupture of appendix.SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a widow. She lives alone. She does have three daughters, two of them live in Georgia and one lives in Tennessee. She did smoke in the past up to one to one and a half packs of cigarettes per day for about 10 years, but she quit long time ago. She never drank any alcohol. She likes to drink one or two cups of tea in a day.
ALLERGIES:  PAXIL.MEDICATIONS: Her home medications prior to coming in include some of the following medications, although the exact list is not available in the chart at this stage, but they have been on glyburide, Januvia, lisinopril, metformin, metoprolol, simvastatin, ranitidine, meloxicam, and furosemide.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Appetite is good. She sleeps good at night.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Atypical pneumonia, hypoxia, rheumatoid arthritis, and suspected mild stress-induced adrenal insufficiency. This very independent 79-year old had struggled with cough, fevers, weakness, and chills for the week prior to admission.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:1. Pneumonia, failed outpatient treatment.2. Hypoxia.3. Rheumatoid arthritis.DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:1. Atypical pneumonia, suspected viral.2. Hypoxia.3. Rheumatoid arthritis.4. Suspected mild stress-induced adrenal insufficiency.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This very independent 79-year old had struggled with cough, fevers, weakness, and chills for the week prior to admission. She was seen on multiple occasions at Urgent Care and in her physician's office. Initial x-ray showed some mild diffuse patchy infiltrates. She was first started on Avelox, but had a reaction, switched to Augmentin, which caused loose stools, and then three days prior to admission was given daily 1 g Rocephin and started on azithromycin. Her O2 saturations drifted downward. They were less than 88% when active; at rest, varied between 88% and 92%. Decision was made because of failed outpatient treatment of pneumonia. Her medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis. She is on 20 mg of methotrexate every week as well as Remicade every eight weeks. Her last dose of Remicade was in the month of June. Hospital course was relatively unremarkable. CT scan was performed and no specific focal pathology was seen. Dr. X, pulmonologist was consulted. He also was uncertain as to the exact etiology, but viral etiology was most highly suspected. Because of her loose stools, C. difficile toxin was ordered, although that is pending at the time of discharge. She was continued on Rocephin IV and azithromycin. Her fever broke 18 hours prior to discharge, and O2 saturations improved, as did her overall strength and clinical status. She was instructed to finish azithromycin. She has two pills left at home. She is to follow up with Dr. X in two to three days. Because she is on chronic prednisone therapy, it was suspected that she was mildly adrenal insufficient from the stress of her pneumonia. She is to continue the increased dose of prednisone at 20 mg (up from 5 mg per day). We will consult her rheumatologist as to whether to continue her methotrexate, which we held this past Friday. Methotrexate is known on some occasions to cause pneumonitis.

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Mild tracheobronchitis with history of granulomatous disease and TB, rule out active TB/miliary TB.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy diagnostic with:a. Right middle lobe bronchoalveolar lavage.b. Right upper lobe bronchoalveolar lavage.c. Right lower lobe transbronchial biopsies.COMPLICATIONS: None.Samples include bronchoalveolar lavage of the right upper lobe and right middle lobe and transbronchial biopsies of the right lower lobe.
INDICATION: The patient with a history of TB and caseating granulomata on open lung biopsy with evidence of interstitial lung disease and question tuberculosis.PROCEDURE: After obtaining an informed consent, the patient was brought to the Bronchoscopy Suite with appropriate isolation related to ______ precautions. The patient had appropriate oxygen, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate monitoring applied and monitored continuously throughout the procedure. 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula was applied to the nasopharynx with 100% saturations achieved. Topical anesthesia with 10 cc of 4% Xylocaine was applied to the right nares and oropharynx. Subsequent to this, the patient was premedicated with 50 mg of Demerol and then Versed 1 mg sequentially for a total of 2 mg. With this, adequate consciousness sedation was achieved. 3 cc of 4% viscous Xylocaine was applied to the right nares. The bronchoscope was then advanced through the right nares into the nasopharynx and oropharynx.The oropharynx and larynx were well visualized and showed mild erythema, mild edema, otherwise negative.There was normal vocal cord motion without masses or lesions. Additional topical anesthesia with 2% Xylocaine was applied to the larynx and subsequently throughout the tracheobronchial tree for a total of 18 cc. The bronchoscope was then advanced through the larynx into the trachea. The trachea showed mild evidence of erythema and moderate amounts of clear frothy secretions. These were suctioned clear. The bronchoscope was then advanced through the carina, which was sharp. Then advanced into the left main stem and each segment, subsegement in the left upper lingula and lower lobe was visualized. There was mild tracheobronchitis with mild friability throughout. There was modest amounts of white secretion. There were no other findings including evidence of mass, anatomic distortions, or hemorrhage. The bronchoscope was subsequently withdrawn and advanced into the right mainstem. Again, each segment and subsegment was well visualized. The right upper lobe anatomy showed some segmental distortion with dilation and irregularities both at the apical region as well as in the subsegments of the anteroapical and posterior segments. No specific masses or other lesions were identified throughout the tracheobronchial tree on the right. There was mild tracheal bronchitis with friability. Upon coughing, there was punctate hemorrhage. The bronchoscope was then advanced through the bronchus intermedius and the right middle lobe and right lower lobe. These again had no other anatomic lesions identified. The bronchoscope was then wedged in the right middle lobe and bronchoalveolar samples were obtained. The bronchoscope was withdrawn and the area was suctioned clear. The bronchoscope was then advanced into the apical segment of the right upper lobe and the bronchioalveolar lavage again performed. Samples were taken and the bronchoscope was removed suctioned the area clear. The bronchoscope was then re-advanced into the right lower lobe and multiple transbronchial biopsies were taken under fluoroscopic guidance in the posterior and lateral segments of the right lower lobe. Minimal hemorrhage was identified and suctioned clear without difficulty. The bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the mainstem. The area was suctioned clear. Fluoroscopy revealed no evidence of pneumothorax. The bronchoscope was then withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well without evidence of desaturation or complications.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Flexible Bronchoscopy (pediatric)
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
FLEXIBLE BRONCHOSCOPYThe flexible bronchoscopy is performed under conscious sedation in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. I explained to the parents that the possible risks include: irritation of the nasal mucosa, which can be associated with some bleeding; risk of contamination of the lower airways by passage of the scope in the nasopharynx; respiratory depression from sedation; and a very small risk of pneumothorax. A bronchoalveolar lavage may be obtained by injecting normal saline in one of the bronchi and suctioning the fluid back. The sample will then be sent for testing. The flexible bronchoscopy is mainly diagnostic, any therapeutic intervention, if deemed necessary, will be planned and will require a separate procedure.The parents seem to understand, had the opportunity to ask questions and were satisfied with the information. A booklet containing the description of the procedure and other information was provided.

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
REFERRAL INDICATION AND PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSES1. Dilated cardiomyopathy.2. Ejection fraction less than 10%.3. Ventricular tachycardia.4. Bradycardia with likely high degree of pacing.PROCEDURES PLANNED AND PERFORMED1. Implantation of biventricular automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator.2. Fluoroscopic guidance for lead implantation for biventricular automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator.3. Coronary sinus venogram for left ventricular lead placement.
4. Defibrillation threshold testing x2.FLUOROSCOPY TIME: 18.5 minutes.MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF STUDY1. Vancomycin 1 g (the patient was allergic to penicillin).2. Versed 10 mg.3. Fentanyl 100 mcg.4. Benadryl 50 mg.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a pleasant 57-year-old gentleman with a dilated cardiomyopathy, an ejection fraction of 10%, been referred for AICD implantation because of his low ejection fraction and a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. He has underlying sinus bradycardia. Therefore, will likely be pacing much of the time and would benefit from a biventricular pacing device.RISKS AND BENEFITS: Risks, benefits, and alternatives to implantation of biventricular AICD and defibrillation threshold testing were discussed with the patient. Risks including but not limited to bleeding, infection, vascular injury, cardiac perforation, stroke, myocardial infarction, the need for urgent cardiovascular surgery, and death were discussed with the patient. The patient agreed both verbally and via written consent.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was transported to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in the fasting state. The region of the left deltopectoral groove was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Lidocaine 1% (20 mL) was administered to the area. After achieving appropriate anesthesia, a percutaneous access of the left axillary vein was performed under fluoroscopy with two separate sticks. Guidewires were advanced down into the left axillary vein. Following this, a 4-inch long transverse incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue exposing the pectoral fascia and muscle beneath. Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery. Lidocaine 1% (10 mL) was administered to the medial aspect of the incision and a pocket was fashioned in the medial direction. Using the more lateral of the guidewires, a 7-French side-arm sheath was advanced into the left axillary vein. The dilator was removed and another wire was advanced down into the sheath. The sheath was then backed up over the top of the two wires. One wire was pinned to the drape and using the alternate wire, a 9-French side-arm sheath was advanced down into the left axillary vein. The dilator and wire were removed. A defibrillation lead was then advanced down into the atrium. The peel-away sheath was removed. The lead was then passed across the tricuspid valve and positioned in the apical septal location. The active fix screw was deployed. Adequate pacing and sensing functions were established. A 10-volt pacing was used temporarily and there was no diaphragmatic stimulation. The suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue. Using the wire that had been pinned to the drape, a 7-French side-arm sheath was advanced over this wire into the axillary vein. The wire and dilator were removed. An active pacing lead was then advanced down to the right atrium and the peel-away sheath was removed. The lead was parked until a later time. Using the separate access point, a 9-French side-arm sheath was advanced into the left axillary vein. The dilator and wire were removed. A curved outer sheath catheter as well as an inner catheter were advanced down into the area of the coronary sinus. The coronary sinus was cannulated. Inner catheter was removed and a balloon-tipped catheter was advanced into the coronary sinus. A coronary sinus venogram was then performed. It was noted that the most suitable location for lead placement was the middle cardiac vein. This was cannulated and a passive lead was advanced over a Whisper EDS wire into a distal position. Adequate pacing and sensing functions were established. A 10-volt pacing was used temporarily. There was no diaphragmatic stimulation. The outer sheath was peeled away. The 9 French sheath was then peeled away. Suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue. At this point, the atrial lead was then positioned in the right atrial appendage using a preformed J-curved stylet. The lead body was turned several times and the lead was affixed to the tissue. Adequate pacing and sensing function were established. A suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue. The pocket was then washed with antibiotic-impregnated saline. Pulse generator was obtained and connected securely to the leads. The leads were carefully wrapped behind the pulse generator and the entire system was placed in the pocket. The pocket was then closed with 2-0, 3-0, and 4-0 Vicryl using a running mattress stitch. Sponge and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure and no acute complications were noted.The patient was sedated further and shock on T was performed on two separate occasions. The device was allowed to detect the charge and defibrillate, establishing the entire workings of the ICD system.DEVICE DATA1.

Cardiovascular_Pulmonary," Right heart and left heart catheterization by way of right femoral artery, right femoral vein, and right internal jugular vein.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PRECATHETERIZATION DIAGNOSIS (ES): Hypoplastic left heart, status post Norwood procedure and Glenn shunt.POSTCATHETERIZATION DIAGNOSIS (ES):1. Hypoplastic left heart.A. Status post Norwood.B. Status post Glenn.2. Left pulmonary artery hypoplasia.3. Diminished right ventricular systolic function.4. Trivial neo-aortic stenosis.5. Trivial coarctation.
6. Flow to right upper lobe more than left upper lobe from collaterals arising from branches of the aortic arch.PROCEDURE (S): Right heart and left heart catheterization by way of right femoral artery, right femoral vein, and right internal jugular vein.I. PROCEDURES: XXXXXX was brought to the catheterization lab and was anesthetized by anesthesia. He was intubated. His supplemental oxygen was weaned to 24%, on which all of his hemodynamics were obtained. The patient was prepped and draped in the routine sterile fashion, including both groins and the right neck. Xylocaine was administered in the right femoral area. A 6-French sheath was introduced into the right femoral vein percutaneously without complication. A 4-French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery percutaneously without complication. A 4-French pigtail catheter was introduced and passed to the abdominal aorta.Dr. Hayes, using the SiteRite device, introduced a 5-French sheath into the right internal jugular vein without complication.A 5-French wedge catheter was introduced through the sheath in the right internal jugular vein and was passed to the left pulmonary artery and further to the left pulmonary capillary wedge position. This catheter would not pass to the right pulmonary artery. The wedge catheter was removed. A 5-French IMA catheter was then introduced and passed to the right pulmonary artery. After right pulmonary artery pressure was measured, this catheter was removed.
The 5 wedge catheter was advanced through the right femoral sheath and was passed to the following chambers or vessels: Inferior vena cava, right atrium, left atrium, and right ventricle.The previously introduced 4 pigtail catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta. Simultaneous right ventricular and ascending aortic pressures were measured. A pullback from ascending aorta to descending aorta was then performed. Simultaneous measurements of right ventricular and descending aortic pressures were measured.The wedge catheter was removed. A 5-French Berman catheter was advanced down the Glenn shunt to the right pulmonary artery, where a pullback from right pulmonary artery to Glenn shunt was performed. An injection was then performed using Omnipaque 16 mL at 8 mL per second with the Berman catheter positioned in the Glenn shunt. The 5-French Berman was removed.A 6-French Berman was introduced through the right femoral vein sheath and was advanced to the right ventricle. A right ventriculogram was performed using Omnipaque 18 mL at 12 mL per second. The Berman catheter was pulled back to the inferior vena cava, where an inferior vena cavagram was performed using Omnipaque 10 mL at 8 mL per second.The 4-French pigtail catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta and an ascending aortogram was performed using Omnipaque 16 mL at 12 mL per second.
Following the ascending angiograms, two kidneys and a bladder were noted. The catheters and sheaths were removed, and hemostasis was obtained by direct pressure. The estimated blood loss was less than 30 mL, and none was replaced. Heparin was administered following placement of all of the sheaths. Pulse oximetry saturation, pulse in the right foot, and EKG were monitored continuously.II. PRESSURES:A. Left pulmonary artery, mean of 11; left capillary wedge, mean of 9; main pulmonary artery, mean of 12; right pulmonary artery, mean of 10; descending aorta, 75/45, mean of 57; right atrium, A6 to 9, V6 to 8, mean 7; left atrium, mean 8; inferior vena cava, mean 7.B. Ascending aorta, 65/35, with a simultaneous right ventricular pressure of 70/10; descending aorta, 60/35, with a right ventricular pressure of 72/10.C. Pullbacks, left pulmonary artery to main pulmonary artery, mean of 11 to mean of 12; main pulmonary artery to Glenn, mean of 12 to mean of 13; right pulmonary artery to Glenn, mean of 12 to mean of 13; ascending aorta 68/35 to descending aorta 62/35.INTERPRETATION: Right and left pulmonary artery pressures are appropriate for this situation. There is a gradient of, at most, 2 mmHg on pullback from both the right and left pulmonary arteries to the Glenn shunt. The left atrial mean pressure is normal. Right ventricular end-diastolic pressure is, at most, slightly elevated. There is a trivial gradient between the right ventricle and ascending aorta consistent with trivial neo-aortic valve stenosis. There is a roughly 10-mm gradient between the right ventricle and descending aorta, consistent with additional coarctation of the aorta. On pullback from ascending to descending aorta, there is a 6-mmHg gradient between the two. Systemic blood pressure is normal.
III. OXIMETRY: Superior vena cava 65, right pulmonary artery 67, left pulmonary artery 65, left atrium 96, right atrium 87, inferior vena cava 69, aorta 86, right ventricle 83.INTERPRETATION: Systemic arteriovenous oxygenation difference is normal, consistent with a normal cardiac output. Left atrial saturation is fairly normal, consistent with normal oxygenation in the lungs. The saturation falls passing from the left atrium to the right atrium and further to the right ventricle, consistent with mixing of pulmonary venous return and inferior vena cava return, as would be expected in this patient.IV. SPECIAL PROCEDURE (S): None done.V. CALCULATIONS:Please see the calculation sheet. Calculations were based upon an assumed oxygen consumption. The _____ saturation used was 67%, with a pulmonary artery saturation of 65%, a left atrial saturation of 96%, and an aortic saturation of 86%. Using the above information, the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio was 0.6. Systemic blood flow was 5.1 liters per minute per meter squared. Pulmonary blood flow was 3.2 liters per minute per meter squared. Systemic resistance was 9.8 Wood's units times meter squared, which is mildly diminished. Pulmonary resistance was 2.5 Wood's units times meter squared, which is in the normal range.
VI. ANGIOGRAPHY: The injection to the Glenn shunt demonstrates a wide-open Glenn connection. The right pulmonary artery is widely patent, without stenosis. The proximal portion of the left pulmonary artery is significantly narrowed, but does open up near its branch point. The right pulmonary artery measures 6.5, the left pulmonary artery measures 3.0 mm. The aorta at the diaphragm on a later injection was 5.5 mm. There is a small collateral off the innominate vein passing to the left upper lobe. Flow to both upper lobes is diminished versus lower lung fields. There is normal return of the pulmonary veins from the right, with simultaneous filling of the left atrium and right atrium. There is normal return of the left lower pulmonary vein and left upper pulmonary vein. There is some reflux of dye into the inferior vena cava from the right atrium.The right ventriculogram demonstrates a heavily pedunculated right ventricle with somewhat depressed right ventricular systolic function. The calculated ejection fraction from the LAO projection is only mildly diminished at 59%. There is no significant tricuspid regurgitation. The neo-aortic valve appears to open well with no stenosis. The ascending aorta is dilated. There is mild narrowing of the aorta at the isthmal area. On some projections, there appears to be a partial duplication of the aortic arch, probably secondary to this patient's style of Norwood reconstruction. There is some filling of the right upper and left upper lobes from collateral blood flow, with the left being more opacified than the right.The inferior vena cavagram demonstrates normal return of the inferior vena cava to the right atrium.The ascending aortogram demonstrates trivial aortic insufficiency, which is probably catheter-induced. The coronary arteries are poorly seen. Again, a portion of the aorta appears to be partially duplicated. There is faint opacification of the left upper lung from collateral blood flow. The above-mentioned narrowing of the aortic arch is again noted.

Orthopedic," The patient was evaluated today in follow up evaluation. She continues to suffer from ongoing neck and lower back pain with no recent radicular complaints. Her evaluation today reveals restriction in the range of motion of the cervical and lumbar region with tenderness and spasms of the paraspinal musculature. Motor strength was 5/5 on the MRC scale. Reflexes were 2+ and symmetrical. Palpable trigger points were noted bilaterally in the trapezius and lumbar paraspinal musculature bilaterally. Palpable trigger points were noted on today's evaluation. She is suffering from ongoing myofascitis. Her treatment plan will consist of a series of trigger point injections, which were performed today. She tolerated the procedure well. I have asked her to ice the region intermittently for 15 minutes off and on x 3. She will be followed in four weeks' time for repeat trigger point injections if indicated."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Trimalleolar ankle fracture. 2. Dislocation right ankle. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Trimalleolar ankle fracture. 2. Dislocation right ankle. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Closed open reduction and internal fixation of right ankle. ANESTHESIA: Spinal with sedation. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: 75 minutes at 325 mmHg. COMPONENTS: Synthes small fragment set was used including a 2.5 mm drill bed. A six hole one-third tibial plate, one 12 mm 3.5 mm cortical screw fully threaded and two 16 mm 3.5 mm cortical fully-threaded screws. There were two 20 mm 4.0 cancellous screws and one 18 mm 4.0 cancellous screw placed. There were two 4.0 cancellous partially-threaded screws placed. GROSS FINDINGS: Include a comminuted fracture involving the lateral malleolus as well as a medial and posterior malleolus fracture as well. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 87-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room complaining of right ankle pain status post a trip and fall. The patient noted while walking with a walker, apparently tripped and fell. The patient had significant comorbidities, seen and evaluated by the Emergency Room Department as well as Department of Orthopedics while in the Emergency Room. At that time, a closed reduction was performed and she was placed in a Robert-Jones splint. After complete medical workup and clearance, we elected to take her to the operating room for definitive care. PROCEDURE: After all potential complications and risks as well as risks and benefits of the above-mentioned procedure was discussed at length with the patient and family, informed consent was obtained. The upper extremity was then confirmed with the operating surgeon, the patient, the nursing staff and Department of Anesthesia. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area in the Operative Suite #3 and placed on the operating room table in supine position. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia administered spinal anesthetic to the patient as well as sedation. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the right upper thigh of the patient. This was then removed and the right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The right lower extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using Esmarch and tourniquet was then placed to 325 mmHg and kept up to a total of 75 minutes. Next, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this vestibule on the right ankle. A sharp dissection was carefully taken down to the level of bone taking care to protect the neurovascular structures. Once the bone was reached, the fractured site was identified. The bony ends were then opened and divided of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum within the fracture site. The wound was copiously irrigated and dried. Next, the fracture was then reduced in anatomic position. There was noted to be quite a bit of comminution as well as soft overall status of the bone. It was held in place with reduction forceps. A six hole one-third tubular Synthes plate was then selected for instrumentation. It was contoured using ________ and placed on the lateral aspect of the distal fibula. Next, the three most proximal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged and then a 3.5 mm fully threaded cortical screw was placed in each. The most proximal was a 12 mm and the next two were 16 mm in length. Next, the three most distal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged, and a 4.0 cancellous screw was placed in each hole. The most distal with a 20 mm and two most proximal were 18 mm in length. Next the Xi-scan was used to visualize the hardware placement as well as the fracture reduction appeared to be in good anatomic position, all hardware was in good position. There was no lateralization of the joints. Attention was then directed towards the medial aspect of the ankle. Again, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 4 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over the medial malleolus. Again, the dissection was carefully taken down the level of the fracture site. The retractors were then placed to protect all neurovascular structures. Once the fracture site was identified, it was dried of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum. The fracture site was then displaced and the ankle joint was visualized including the dome of the talus. There appeared to be some minor degenerative changes of the talus, but no loose bodies. Next, the wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The medial malleolus was placed in reduced position and held in place with a 1.25 mm K-wire. Next, the 2.5 mm drill bed was then used to sequentially drill holes to full depth and 4.0 cancellous screws were placed in each, each with a 45 mm in length. These appeared to hold the fracture site securely in an anatomic position. Again, Xi-scan was brought in to confirm placement of the screws. They were in good overall position and there was no lateralization of the joint. At this time, each wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The wounds were then closed using #2-0 Vicryl suture in subcutaneous fashion followed by staples on the skin. A sterile dressing was applied consistent with Adaptic, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Webril. A Robert-Jones style splint was then placed on the right lower extremity. This was covered by a 4-inch Depuy dressing. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney and to the Postanesthetic Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. EMG-proven left carpal tunnel syndrome. 2. Tenosynovitis of the left third and fourth fingers at the A1 and A2 pulley level. 3. Dupuytren's nodule in the palm. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. EMG-proven left carpal tunnel syndrome. 2. Tenosynovitis of the left third and fourth fingers at the A1 and A2 pulley level. 3. Dupuytren's nodule in the palm. PROCEDURE: Left carpal tunnel release with flexor tenosynovectomy; cortisone injection of trigger fingers, left third and fourth fingers; injection of Dupuytren's nodule, left palm. ANESTHESIA: Local plus IV sedation (MAC). ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Zero. SPECIMENS: None. DRAINS: None. PROCEDURE DETAIL: Patient brought to the operating room. After induction of IV sedation the left hand was anesthetized suitable for carpal tunnel release; 10 cc of a mixture of 1% Xylocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected in the distal forearm and proximal palm suitable for carpal tunnel surgery. Routine prep and drape was employed. Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure. Hand was positioned palm up in the lead hand-holder. A short curvilinear incision about the base of the thenar eminence was made. Skin was sharply incised. Sharp dissection was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament and this was carefully incised longitudinally along its ulnar margin. Care was taken to divide the entire length of the transverse retinaculum including its distal insertion into deep palmar fascia in the midpalm. Proximally the antebrachial fascia was released for a distance of 2-3 cm proximal to the wrist crease to insure complete decompression of the median nerve. Retinacular flap was retracted radially to expose the contents of the carpal canal. Median nerve was identified, seen to be locally compressed with moderate erythema and mild narrowing. Locally adherent tenosynovium was present and this was carefully dissected free. Additional tenosynovium was dissected from the flexor tendons, individually stripping and peeling each tendon in sequential order so as to debulk the contents of the carpal canal. Epineurotomy and partial epineurectomy were carried out on the nerve in the area of mild constriction to relieve local external scarring of the epineurium. When this was complete retinacular flap was laid loosely in place over the contents of the carpal canal and skin only was closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon horizontal mattress sutures. A syringe with 3 cc of Kenalog-10 and 3 cc of 1% Xylocaine using a 25 gauge short needle was then selected; 1 cc of this mixture was injected into the third finger A1 and A2 pulley tendon sheaths using standard trigger finger injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the fourth finger A1/A2 pulley tendon sheath using standard tendon sheath injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the Dupuytren's nodule in the midpalm to relieve local discomfort. Routine postoperative hand dressing with well-padded, well-molded volar plaster splint and lightly compressive Ace wrap was applied. Tourniquet was deflated. Good vascular color and capillary refill were seen to return to the tips of all digits. Patient discharged to the ambulatory recovery area and from there discharged home. Discharge medication is Darvocet-N 100, 30 tablets, one to two PO q.4h. p.r.n. Patient asked to begin gentle active flexion, extension and passive nerve glide exercises beginning 24-48 hours after surgery. She was asked to keep the dressings clean, dry and intact and follow up in my office."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Pathologic insufficiency. 2. Fracture of the T8 vertebrae and T9 vertebrae. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Pathologic insufficiency. 2. Fracture of the T8 vertebra and T9 vertebra. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Fracture reduction with insertion of prosthetic device at T8 with kyphoplasty. 2. Vertebroplasties at T7 and T9 with insertion of prosthetic device. ANESTHESIA: Local with sedation. SPECIMEN: Bone from the T8 vertebra. COMPLICATIONS: None. SURGICAL INDICATIONS: The patient is an 80-year-old female who had previous history of compression fractures. She had recently undergone an additional compression fracture of the T8 vertebrae. She was in extreme pain. This pain interfered with activities of daily living and was unimproved with conservative treatment modalities. She is understanding the risks, benefits, and potential complications as well as all treatment alternatives. The patient provided informed consent. OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: The patient was taken to OR #2 where she was placed prone on the Jackson spinal table. She was given sedative. The thoracodorsal spine was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Biplanar image intensification was utilized to localize the T8, T7, and T9 vertebrae. Local anesthetic of 1% Marcaine with epinephrine and lidocaine were 50:50 mixed. Approximately 7 cc was instilled on the left side. This was directly over the posterior aspect of the pedicle on the left. Once this was localized, the right side was localized as well. Stab incisions were then created over the pedicles of T8 bilaterally. Jamshidi needles were then placed percutaneously. Their position was verified in both AP and lateral images. They were advanced slowly under direct image intensification in biplanar fashion. Once these were satisfactorily placed, the inner trocar was removed and a guidewire was inserted into the depths of the T7 vertebrae. The Jamshidi needles were then removed. A biopsy was then harvested with a biopsy trocar placed into the T8 vertebrae. This bone was then removed and sent to the lab. The injection cannulas were then placed over the guidewires and their position was verified in both AP and lateral images. Once this was completed, a second Jamshidi needle was placed at the T7 vertebrae on the left at the entrance of the pedicle. This was advanced under direct image intensification in a biplanar fashion. Once this was deemed satisfactory, it was impacted. The inner trocar was removed and a guidewire was then placed. An injection cannula was then placed over the guidewire into the body of T7. In a similar fashion, T9 was dressed on the left side as well. A guidewire was then placed through the Jamshidi needle, which was verified in both AP and lateral images. The cement injection cannula was then placed over this entering the T9 vertebrae body. Attention was then turned to the kyphoplasty portion of the procedure at the T8 vertebrae. The balloons were inserted bilaterally. The balloons were then inflated under direct image intensification and pressurized to approximately 200 mmHg. These were allowed to expand and reduce the fracture. Once this was completed, the balloons were deflated and removed. The inner cannulas of all four entrance holes were removed and approximately 1.5 cc of cement was injected in each of the cannulas. This was done directly under image intensification. Once this was completed, additional cement was injected into T9 as there was a larger vertebra. The cement was allowed to cure. The cannula was removed and final radiographs were obtained. The stab incisions were then cleansed with water and antibiotic irrigation. The wounds were then approximated with #4-0 Nylon in interrupted fashion. Compression dressings were applied and fixed with tape. She was aroused and moved to her inpatient bed. She was moving all four extremities without deficit. She had no significant pain."
Orthopedic," PROCEDURE: Bilateral L5 dorsal ramus block and bilateral S1, S2, and S3 lateral branch block. INDICATION: Sacroiliac joint pain. INFORMED CONSENT: The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient. The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks. The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible vascular entry of medications. I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids. The patient was informed both verbally and in writing. The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed. PROCEDURE: Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure. The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback. The X-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine. The patient was placed in the prone position on the treatment table, pillow under the chest, and head rotated contralateral to the side being treated. The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine. The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement. Fluoroscopic pillar view was used to identify the bony landmarks of the sacrum and sacroiliac joint and the planned needle approach. The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine. With fluoroscopy, a 25-gauge 3.5-inch spinal needle was gently guided into the groove between the SAP and sacrum through the dorsal ramus of the L5 and the lateral and superior border of the posterior sacral foramen with the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3. Multiple fluoroscopic views were used to ensure proper needle placement. Approximately 0.25 mL of nonionic contrast agent was injected showing no concurrent vascular dye pattern. Finally, the treatment solution, consisting of 0.5% of bupivacaine was injected to each area. All injected medications were preservative free. Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure. ADDITIONAL DETAILS: This was then repeated on the left side. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISCUSSION: Postprocedure vital signs and oximetry were stable. The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day. The patient was told to resume all medications. The patient was told to resume normal activities. The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes or changes in bowel or bladder function. Follow up appointment was made at the PM&R Spine Clinic in approximately 1 week."
Orthopedic," PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified. The patient was placed on the operating room table in supine position and given anesthetic. Once adequate anesthesia had been achieved, a careful examination of the shoulder was performed. It revealed no patholigamentous laxity. We then placed the patient into a beach-chair position, maintaining a neutral alignment of the head, neck, and thorax. The shoulder was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. We then injected the glenohumeral joint with 60 cc of sterile saline solution. A small stab incision was made 2 cm inferior and 2 cm medial to the posterolateral angle of the acromion. Through this incision, a blunt trocar was placed. We then placed the camera through this cannula and the shoulder was insufflated with sterile saline solution. An anterior portal was made just below the subscapularis and then we began to inspect the shoulder joint. We found that the articular surface was in good condition. The biceps was found to be intact. There was a SLAP tear noted just posterior to the biceps. Pictures were taken. No Bankart or Hill-Sachs lesions were noted. The rotator cuff was examined and there were no undersurface tears. Pictures were again taken. We then made a lateral portal going through the muscle belly of the rotator cuff. A drill hole was made and then knotless suture anchor was placed to repair this. Pictures were taken. We then washed out the joint with copious amounts of sterile saline solution. It was drained. Our 3 incisions were closed using 3-0 nylon suture. A pain pump catheter was introduced into the shoulder joint. Xeroform, 4 x 4s, ABDs, tape, and sling were placed. The patient was successfully taken out of the beach-chair position, extubated and brought to the recovery room in stable condition. I then went out and spoke with the patient's family, going over the case, postoperative instructions, and followup care."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right shoulder rotator cuff tear. 2. Glenohumeral rotator cuff arthroscopy. 3. Degenerative joint disease. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right shoulder rotator cuff tear. 2. Glenohumeral rotator cuff arthroscopy. 3. Degenerative joint disease. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Right shoulder hemiarthroplasty. ANESTHESIA: General. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Approximately 125 cc. COMPLICATIONS: None. COMPONENTS: A DePuy 10 mm global shoulder system stem was used cemented and a DePuy 44 x 21 mm articulating head was used. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is an 82-year-old right-hand dominant female who presents for shoulder pain for many years now and affecting her daily living and function and pain is becoming unbearable failing conservative treatment. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operative suite, placed on the operative field. Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic. Once adequately sedated, the patient was placed in the beach chair position. Care was ensured that she was well positioned, adequately secured and padded. At this point, the right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A deltopectoral approach was used and taken down to the skin with a #15 blade scalpel. At this point, blunt dissection with Mayo scissors was used to come to the overlying subscapular tendon and bursal tissue. Any perforating bleeders were cauterized with Bovie to obtain hemostasis. Once the bursa was seen, it was removed with a Rongeur and subscapular tendon could be easily visualized. At this point, the rotator cuff in the subacromial region was evaluated. There was noted to be a large rotator cuff, which was irreparable. There was eburnated bone on the greater tuberosity noted. The articular surface could be visualized. The biceps tendon was intact. There was noted to be diffuse discolored synovium around this as well as some fraying of the tendon in the intraarticular surface. The under surface of the acromion, it was felt there was mild ware on this as well. At this point, the subscapular tendon was then taken off using Bovie cautery and Metzenbaum scissors that was tied with Metzenbaum suture. It was separated from the capsule to have a two layered repair at closure. The capsule was also reflected posterior. At this point, the glenoid surface could be easily visualized. It was evaluated and had good cartilage contact and appeared to be intact. The humeral head was evaluated. There was noted to be ware of the cartilage and eburnated bone particularly in the central portion of the humeral head. At this point, decision was made to proceed with the arthroplasty, since the rotator cuff tear was irreparable and there was significant ware of the humoral head. The arm was adequately positioned. An oscillating saw was used to make the head articular cut. This was done at the margin of the articular surface with the anatomic neck. This was taken down to appropriate level until this articular surface was adequately removed. At this point, the intramedullary canal and cancellous bone could be easily visualized. The opening hand reamers were then used and this was advanced to a size #10. Under direct visualization, this was performed easily. At this point, the 10 x 10 proximal flange cutter was then inserted and impacted into place to cut grooves for the fins. This was then removed. A trial component was then impacted into place, which did fit well and trial heads were then sampled and it was felt that a size 44 x 21 mm head gave us the best fit and appeared adequately secured. It did not appear overstuffed with evidence of excellent range of motion and no impingement. At this point, the trial component was removed. Wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. Cement was then placed with a cement gun into the canal and taken up to the level of the cut. The prosthesis was then inserted into place and held under direct visualization. All excess cement was removed and care was ensured that no cement was left in the posterior aspect of the joint itself. This _______ cement was adequately hard at this point. The final component of the head was impacted into place, secured on the Morris taper and checked, and this was reduced. The final component was then taken through range of motion and found to have excellent stability and was satisfied with its position. The wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. At this point, the capsule was then reattached to its insertion site in the anterior portion. Once adequately sutured with #1-Vicryl, attention was directed to the subscapular. The subscapular was advanced superiorly and anchored not only to the biceps tendon region, but also to the top anterior portion of the greater tuberosity. This was opened to allow some type of coverage points of the massive rotator cuff tear. This was secured to the tissue and interosseous sutures with size #2 fiber wire. After this was adequately secured, the wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The deltoid fascial split was then repaired using interrupted #2-0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue was then approximated using interrupted #24-0 Vicryl, skin was approximated using a running #4-0 Vicryl. Steri-Strips and Adaptic, 4 x 4s, and ABDs were then applied. The patient was then placed in a sling and transferred back to the gurney, reversed by Department of Anesthesia. DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated well and transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in satisfactory condition."
Orthopedic," REASON FOR NEUROLOGICAL CONSULTATION: Cervical spondylosis and kyphotic deformity. The patient was seen in conjunction with medical resident Dr. X. I personally obtained the history, performed examination, and generated the impression and plan. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 45-year-old African-American female whose symptoms first started some one and a half years ago with pain in the left shoulder and some neck pain. This has subsequently resolved. She started vigorous workouts in November 2005. In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician. By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made. She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits. She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe. Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe. She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm. She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg. Symptoms have been mildly progressive. She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above. She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms. No particular position relieves her symptoms. Workup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed below. She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression was raised. At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Ocular migraines. 2. Myomectomy. 3. Infertility. 4. Hyperglycemia. 5. Asthma. 6. Hypercholesterolemia. MEDICATIONS: Lipitor, Pulmicort, Allegra, Xopenex, Patanol, Duac topical gel, Loprox cream, and Rhinocort. ALLERGIES: Penicillin and aspirin. Family history, social history, and review of systems are discussed above as well as documented in the new patient information sheet. Of note, she does not drink or smoke. She is married with two adopted children. She is a paralegal specialist. She used to exercise vigorously, but of late has been advised to stop exercising and is currently only walking. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She does complain of mild blurred vision, but these have occurred before and seem associated with headaches. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, blood pressure 138/82, pulse 90, respiratory rate 14, and weight 176.5 pounds. Pain scale is 0. A full general and neurological examination was personally performed and is documented on the chart. Of note, she has a normal general examination. Neurological examination reveals normal cognition and cranial nerve examination including normal jaw jerk. She has mild postural tremor in both arms. She has mild decreased sensation in the right palm and mild decreased light touch in the right palm and decreased vibration sense in both distal lower extremities. Motor examination reveals no weakness to individual muscle testing, but on gait she does have a very subtle left hemiparesis. She has hyperreflexia in her lower extremities, worse on the left. Babinski's are downgoing. PERTINENT DATA: MRI of the brain from 05/02/06 and MRI of the C-spine from 05/02/06 and 07/25/06 were personally reviewed. MRI of the brain is broadly within normal limits. MRI of the C-spine reveals large central disc herniation at C6-C7 with evidence of mild cord compression and abnormal signal in the cord suggesting cord edema. There is also a fairly large disc at C3-C4 with cord deformity and partial effacement of the subarachnoid space. I do not appreciate any cord edema at this level. IMPRESSION AND PLAN: The patient is a 45-year-old female with cervical spondylosis with a large C6-C7 herniated disc with mild cord compression and signal change at that level. She has a small disc at C3-C4 with less severe and only subtle cord compression. History and examination are consistent with signs of a myelopathy. Results were discussed with the patient and her mother. I am concerned about progressive symptoms. Although she only has subtle symptoms now, we made her aware that with progression of this process, she may have paralysis. If she is involved in any type of trauma to the neck such as motor vehicle accident, she could have an acute paralysis. I strongly recommended to her and her mother that she followup with you as soon as possible for surgical evaluation. I agree with the previous physicians who have told her not to exercise as I am sure that her vigorous workouts and weight training since November 2005 have contributed to this problem. I have recommended that she wear a hard collar while driving. The results of my consultation were discussed with you telephonically."
Orthopedic," IDENTIFICATION: The patient is a 15-year-old female. CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right ankle pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was running and twisted her right ankle. There were no other injuries. She complains of right ankle pain on the lateral aspect. She is brought in by her mother. Her primary care physician is Dr. Brown. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise negative except as stated above. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: None. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: None. MEDICATIONS: None. SOCIAL HISTORY: Mother appears loving and caring. There is no evidence of abuse. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General: The patient is alert and oriented x4 in mild distress without diaphoresis. She is nonlethargic and nontoxic. Vitals: Within normal limits. The right ankle shows no significant swelling. There is no ecchymosis. There is no significant tenderness to palpation. The ankle has good range of motion. The foot is nontender. Vascular: +2/2 dorsalis pedis pulse. All compartments are soft. Capillary refill less than 2 seconds. DIAGNOSTIC TEST: The patient had an x-ray of the right ankle, which interpreted by myself shows no acute fracture or dislocation. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING: Due to the fact this patient has no evidence of an ankle fracture, she can be safely discharged to home. She is able to walk on it without significant pain, thus I recommend rest for 1 week and follow up with the doctor if she has persistent pain. She may need to see a specialist, but at this time this is a very mild ankle injury. There is no significant physical finding, and I foresee no complications. I will give her 1 week off of PE. MORBIDITY/MORTALITY: I expect no acute complications. A full medical screening exam was done and no emergency medical condition exists upon discharge. COMPLEXITY: Moderate. The differential includes fracture, contusion, abrasion, laceration, and sprain. ASSESSMENT: Right ankle sprain. PLAN: Discharge the patient home and have her follow up with her doctor in 1 week if symptoms persist. She is advised to return immediately p.r.n. severe pain, worsening, not better, etc."
Orthopedic," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left wrist pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT PROBLEM: The patient has a previous history of a left traumatic wrist injury, which has left him with a chronic scapholunate problem and possibly other problems in his wrist. However, he was doing relatively fine and tolerating the wrist soreness that he had, which is day to day, but it has not gotten much worse until this injury. Once he lifted the object out of the back of his car and it started to hurt, then he was significantly more affected than he was before, and now pain is more on the ulnar side of his wrist than on the radial side of his wrist. He is here now for evaluation. CLINICAL/PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Musculoskeletal: The patient has point tenderness to palpation along the ulnar styloid ECU ridge with some minor tenderness at the TFC region, as well as the lunotriquetral joint. There is some minor soreness, but not nearly as sore at the SL ligament with dorsiflexion 30&deg;, palmar flexion 30&deg;, radial deviation 5&deg; and ulnar deviation 0&deg;. Supination/pronation grossly intact without significant signs of instability. Negative piano key sign compared to the contralateral side. Skin: No skin breakdown or hyperhidrosis. Neurologic: Negative signs of compressive median nerve neuropathy. Vascular: Intact. RADIOLOGICAL/LABORATORY EXAM: X-rays, three views of the wrist of good penetrance and quality, reveal scapholunate widening of a slack wrist with a possible ulnar styloid nonunion, with a possible occult distal radius fracture fibrous union. MRI report reviewed. EVALUATION/TREATMENT PLAN: The MRI is consistent with edema and swelling in the ulnar styloid region, which is consistent with the injury pattern that he is claiming and where he is most sore. He has a chronic problem that needs to potentially be addressed. Sometimes with these acute on chronic problems, what was tolerated initially may no longer be tolerated by the patient, which we talked about. Our focus still should be on the initial injury which brought him in at this time. It is a three-week-old injury. Given the MRI, we probably have seen on radiographs a fibrous union between that ulnar styloid and the remaining portion of the ulna, which may have been torn or injured, especially consistent with the MRI. Therefore, I would cast him initially to get that to heal, and then reassess. All questions were answered, and we will make the treatment plans accordingly. He will followup in two weeks. We casted him."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Carpal tunnel syndrome. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Carpal tunnel syndrome. PROCEDURE: Endoscopic release of left transverse carpal ligament. ANESTHESIA: Monitored anesthesia care with regional anesthesia provided by surgeon. TOURNIQUET TIME: 12 minutes. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: With the patient under adequate monitored anesthesia, the left upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner. The arm was exsanguinated. The tourniquet was elevated at 290 mmHg. Construction lines were made on the left palm to identify the ring ray. A transverse incision was made in the palm between FCR and FCU, one finger breadth proximal to the interval between the glabrous skin of the palm and normal forearm skin. Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia. Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery. A distal based window in the antebrachial fascia was then fashioned. Care was taken to protect the underlying contents. A synovial elevator was used to palpate the undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament, and synovium was elevated off this undersurface. Hamate sounds were then used to palpate the Hood of Hamate. The Agee Inside Job was then inserted into the proximal incision. The transverse carpal ligament was easily visualized through the portal. Using palmar pressure, transverse carpal ligament was held against the portal as the instrument was inserted down the transverse carpal ligament to the distal end. The distal end of the transverse carpal ligament was then identified in the window. The blade was then elevated, and the Agee Inside Job was withdrawn, dividing transverse carpal ligament under direct vision. After complete division of transverse carpal ligament, the Agee Inside Job was reinserted. Radial and ulnar edges of the transverse carpal ligament were identified and complete release was accomplished. One cc of Celestone was then introduced into the carpal tunnel and irrigated free. The wound was then closed with a running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch. Steri-strips were applied and a sterile dressing was applied over the Steri-strips. The tourniquet was deflated. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus T8-T9. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus T8-T9. OPERATION PERFORMED: Thoracic right-sided discectomy at T8-T9. BRIEF HISTORY AND INDICATION FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of right thoracic rib pain related to a herniated nucleus pulposus at T8-T9. She has failed conservative measures and sought operative intervention for relief of her symptoms. For details of workup, please see the dictated operative report. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: Appropriate informed consent was obtained and the patient was taken to the operating room and placed under general anesthetic. She was placed in a position of comfort on the operating table with all bony prominences and soft tissues well padded and protected. Second check was made prior to prepping and draping. Following this, we did needle localization with reviews of AP and lateral multiple times to make sure we had the T8-T9 level. We then made an approach through a midline incision and came out over the pars. We dissected down carefully to identify the pars. We then went on the outside of the pars and identified the foramen and then we took another series of x-rays to confirm the T8-T9 level. We did this under live fluoroscopy. We confirmed T8-T9 and then went ahead and took a Midas Rex and removed the superior portion of the pedicle overlying the outside of the disc and then worked our way downward removing portion of the transverse process as well. We found the edge of the disc and then worked our way and we were able to remove some of the disc material but then decided to go ahead and take down the pars. The pars was then drilled out. We identified the disc even further and found the disc herniation material that was under the spinal cord. We then took a combination of small pituitaries and removed the disc material without difficulty. Once we had disc material out, we went ahead and made a small cruciate incision in the disc space and entered the disc space in earnest removing more disc material making sure there is nothing free to herniate further. Once we had done that, we inspected up by the nerve root, found some more disc material there and removed that as well. We could trace the nerve root out freely and easily. We made sure there was no evidence of further disc material. We used an Epstein curette and placed a nerve hook under the nerve root. The Epstein curette removed some more disc material. Once we had done this, we were satisfied with the decompression. We irrigated the wound copiously to make sure there is no further disc material and then ready for closure. We did place some steroid over the nerve root and readied for closure. Hemostasis was meticulous. The wound was closed with #1 Vicryl suture for the fascial layer, 2 Vicryl suture for the skin, and Monocryl and Steri-Strips applied. Dressing was applied. The patient was awoken from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 150 mL. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: To PACU in stable condition having tolerated the procedure well, to mobilize routinely when she is comfortable to go to her home."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Erythema of the right knee and leg, possible septic knee. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Erythema of the right knee superficial and leg, right septic knee ruled out. INDICATIONS: Mr. ABC is a 52-year-old male who has had approximately eight days of erythema over his knee. He has been to multiple institutions as an outpatient for this complaint. He has had what appears to be prepatellar bursa aspirated with little to no success. He has been treated with Kefzol and 1 g of Rocephin one point. He also reports, in the emergency department today, an attempt was made to aspirate his actual knee joint which was unsuccessful. Orthopedic Surgery was consulted at this time. Considering the patient's physical exam, there is a portal that would prove to be outside of the erythema that would be useful for aspiration of the knee. After discussion of risks and benefits, the patient elected to proceed with aspiration through the anterolateral portal of his knee joint. PROCEDURE: The patient's right anterolateral knee area was prepped with Betadine times two and a 20-gauge spinal needle was used to approach the knee joint approximately 3 cm anterior and 2 cm lateral to the superolateral pole of the patella. The 20-gauge spinal needle was inserted and entered the knee joint. Approximately, 4 cc of clear yellow fluid was aspirated. The patient tolerated the procedure well. DISPOSITION: Based upon the appearance of this synovial fluid, we have a very low clinical suspicion of a septic joint. We will send this fluid to the lab for cell count, crystal exam, as well as culture and Gram stain. We will follow these results. After discussion with the emergency department staff, it appears that they tend to try to treat his erythema which appears to be cellulitis with IV antibiotics."
Orthopedic," EXAM:MRI RIGHT ANKLE CLINICAL:This is a 51 year old female who first came into the office 3/4/05 with right ankle pain. She stepped on ice the evening prior and twisted her ankle.

Orthopedic," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 44-year-old man who was seen for complaints of low back and right thigh pain. He attributes this to an incident in which he was injured in 1994. I do not have any paperwork authenticating his claim that there is an open claim. Most recently he was working at Taco Bell, when he had a recurrence of back pain, and he was seen in our clinic on 04/12/05. He rated pain of approximately 8/10 in severity. He took a Medrol Dosepak and states that his pain level has decreased to approximately 4-5/10. He still localizes it to a band between L4 and the sacrum. He initially had some right leg pain but states that this is minimal and intermittent at the present time. His back history is significant for two laminectomies and a discectomy performed from 1990 to 1994. The area of concern was L4-L5. The patient's MRI dated 10/18/04 showed multi-level degenerative changes, with facet involvement at L2-L3, L3-L4 and L5-S1. There was no neural impingement. He also had an MR myelogram, which showed severe stenosis at L3-L4, however it was qualified in that it may have been artifact, rather than a genuine finding. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Focal lower paralumbar pain, affecting both right and left sides, as well as intermittent right leg pain which appears to have improved significantly with the Medrol Dosepak. He denies any recent illness. He has no constitutional complaints such as fevers, chills or sweats. HEENT: The patient denies any cephalgia, ocular, nasopharyngeal symptoms. He has no dysphagia. Cardiovascular: He denies any palpitations, chest pain, syncope or near-syncope. Pulmonary: He denies any dyspnea or respiratory difficulties. GI: The patient has no abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting. GU: The patient denies any urinary frequency or dysuria. There is no gross hematuria. Dermatologic: The patient notes no new onset of rash or other dermatological abnormalities. Musculoskeletal: Denies any recent falls or near-falls. He denies any abnormalities of endocrine, immunologic, hematologic, organ systems. MEDICATIONS: Atenolol, Zestril, Vicodin. ALLERGIES: None. SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS: Lifting limitations of 5 pounds and limited stooping, bending and twisting.

Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Torn anterior cruciate ligament, right knee. 2. Patellofemoral instability, right knee. 3. Possible torn medial meniscus. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Complete tear anterior cruciate ligament, right knee. 2. Complex tear of the posterior horn lateral meniscus. 3. Tear of posterior horn medial meniscus. 4. Patellofemoral instability. 5. Chondromalacia patella. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Diagnostic operative arthroscopy with repair and reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament using autologous hamstring tendon, a 40 mm bioabsorbable femoral pin, and a 9 mm bioabsorbable tibial pin. 2. Repair of lateral meniscus using two fast fixed meniscal repair sutures. 3. Partial medial meniscectomy. 4. Partial chondroplasty of patella. 5. Lateral retinacular release. 6. Open medial plication as well of the right knee. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. TOURNIQUET TIME: 130 minutes at 325 mmHg. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: There was noted to be a grade-II chondromalacia patellofemoral joint. The patella was noted to be situated laterally past the lateral femoral condyle. There was a tear to the posterior horn of the medial meniscus within the white zone. There was a complex tear involving a horizontal cleavage component to the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus as well in the entire meniscus. There was a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament. The posterior cruciate ligament appeared intact. Preoperatively, she had a positive Lachman with a positive pivot shift test as well as increased patellofemoral instability. HISTORY: This is a 39-year-old female who has sustained a twisting injury to her knee while on trampoline in late August. She was diagnosed per MRI. An MRI confirmed the clinical diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament tear. She states she has had multiple episodes of instability to the patellofemoral joint throughout the years with multiple dislocations. She elected to proceed with surgery to repair the anterior cruciate ligament as well as possibly plicate the medial retinaculum to help prevent further dislocations of the patellofemoral joint. All risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with her at length. She was in agreement with the treatment plan. PROCEDURE: On 09/11/03, she was taken to the operating room at ABCD General Hospital. She was placed supine on the operating table. General anesthetic was applied by the Anesthesiology Department. Tourniquet was placed on the proximal thigh and it was then placed in a knee holder. She was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. An Esmarch was used to exsanguinate the lower extremity. Tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg. Longitudinal incision was made just medial to the tibial tubercle. The subcutaneous tissue was carefully dissected. Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery. The tendons of gracilis and semitendinosus were identified and isolated, and then stripped off the musculotendinous junction. They were taken on the back table. The soft tissue debris was removed from the tendons. The ends of the tendons were sewn together using #5 Tycron whip type sutures. The tendons were measured on back table and found to be 8 mm as the most adequate size, they were then placed under tension on the back table. Stab incision was made in the inferolateral parapatellar region, through this camera was placed in the knee. The knee was inflated with saline solution and operative pictures were obtained. The above findings were noted. A second port site was initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region. Through this, a probe was placed. Tear in the posterior horn medial meniscus was identified. It was resected using a meniscal resector. It was then further contoured using arthroscopic shaver. Attention was then taken to the lateral compartment. A partial meniscectomy was performed using the resector and the shaver. The posterior periphery of the lateral meniscus was also noticed to be unstable. A repair was then performed using two fasting fixed meniscal repair sutures to help anchor the meniscus around the popliteus tendon. There was noted to be excellent fixation. The shaver was then taken into the intrachondral notch. First a partial chondroplasty was performed on the patella to remove the loose articular debris as well as a partial synovectomy to the medial aspect of the patellar femoral joint. Next, the remnant of the anterior cruciate ligament was removed using the arthroscopic shaver and arthroplasty was then performed on the medial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle. Next, a tibial guide was placed through the anterior medial portal. A ___ pin was then placed up through the anterior incision entering the tibial eminence just anterior to the posterior cruciate ligament. This tibial tunnel was then drilled using 8 mm cannulated drill. Next, an over-the-top guide was then placed at approximately the 11:30 position. A ____ pin was then placed into the femur and 8 mm drill was then used to drill this femoral tunnel approximately 35 mm. Next the U shape guide was placed through tibial tunnel into the femur. A pin was then placed through the distal femur from lateral to medial, through the U-shaped guide a puller wire was then passed through the distal femur. It was then pulled out through the tibial tunnel using the You-shaped guide. The tendon was then placed around the wire. The wire was pulled back up through the tibial into the femoral tunnel. A 40 mm bioabsorbable pin was then placed through the femoral tunnel securing the hamstring tendons. Attention was then pulled through the tibial tunnel. The knee was cycled approximately 20 times. A 9 mm bioabsorbable screw was then placed through the tibial tunnel fixating the distal aspect of the graft. There was noted definite fixation of the graft. There was no evidence of impingement either in full flexion or full extension. The knee was copiously irrigated and it was then suctioned dry. A longitudinal incision was made just medial to the patellofemoral joint. Soft tissues were carefully dissected and the medial retinaculum was incised along with the incision. Following this, a release of lateral retinaculum was performed using a knife to further release the patellofemoral joint and allow further medial plication. The medial retinaculum was then plicated using #1 Ethibond sutures and then oversewn with #0 Vicryl suture. The subcuticular tissues were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl simple interrupted sutures followed by a #4-0 PDS running subcuticular stitch. She was placed in a DonJoy knee immobilizer. The tourniquet was deflated. It was noted the lower extremity was warm and pink with good capillary refill. She was transferred to the recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition. Prognosis for this patient is guarded. She will be full weightbearing on the lower extremity using the knee immobilizer locked in extension. She may remove her dressing two to three days, however, follow back in the office in 10 to 14 days for suture removal. She will require one to two more physical therapy to help regain motion and strength to the lower extremity."
Orthopedic," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 50-year-old white male complaining of continued lower back pain. Patient has a history of chronic back pain, dating back to an accident that he states he suffered two years ago. He states he helped a friend unload a motorcycle from a vehicle two-and-a-half days ago, after which he &quot;felt it&quot; in his lower back. The following day (two days ago), he states he rode to Massachusetts and Maine to pick up clients. He feels that this aggravated his chronic back pain as well. He also claims to have a screw in his right hip from a previous surgery to repair a pelvic fracture. He is being prescribed Ultram, Celebrex, gabapentin, and amitriptyline by his PCP for his chronic back pain. He states that his PCP has informed him that he does not prescribe opiate medications for chronic back pain. The patient did self-refer to another physician, who suggested that he follow up at a pain clinic for his chronic back pain to discuss other alternatives, particularly the medications that the patient feels that he needs. Patient states he did not do this because he was feeling well at that time. The patient did present to our emergency room last night, at which time he saw Dr. X. He was given a prescription for 12 Vicodin as well as some to take home last night. The patient has not picked up his prescription as of yet and informed the triage nurse that he was concerned that he would not have enough to last through the weekend. Patient states he also has methadone and Darvocet at home from previous prescription and is wondering if he should restart these medicines. He is on several medications, the list of which is attached to the chart. MEDICATIONS: In addition to the aforementioned medications, he is on Cymbalta, pantoprazole, and a multivitamin. ALLERGIES: HE IS ALLERGIC TO RELAFEN (ITCHING). SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and lives with his wife. Nursing notes were reviewed with which I agree. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION VITAL SIGNS: Pulse is elevated at 105. Temp and other vitals signs are all within normal limits. GENERAL: Patient is a middle-aged white male who is sitting on the stretcher in no acute distress. BACK: Exam of the back shows some generalized tenderness on palpation of the musculature surrounding the lumbar spine, more so on the right than on the left. There is a well-healed upper lumbar incision from his previous L1-L2 fusion. There is no erythema, ecchymosis, or soft-tissue swelling. Mobility is generally very good without obvious signs of discomfort. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. LUNGS: Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes. MUSCULOSKELETAL: With the patient supine, there is some discomfort in the lower back with bent-knee flexion of both hips as well as with straight leg abduction of the left leg. There is some mild discomfort on internal and external rotation of the hips as well. DTRs are 1+ at the knees and trace at the ankles. I explained to the patient that he is suffering from a chronic condition and as his PCP has made it clear that he is unwilling to prescribe opiate medication, which the patient feels that he needs, and he is obligated to follow up at the pain clinic as suggested by the other physician even if he is having a &quot;good day.&quot; I explained to him that if he did not investigate other alternatives to what his PCP is willing to prescribe, then on a &quot;bad day,&quot; he will have nowhere else to turn. I explained to him that some emergency physicians do chose to use opiates for a short term as Dr. X did last night. It is unclear if the patient is looking for a different opiate medication, but I do not think it is wise to give him more, particularly as he has not even filled the prescription that was given to him last night. I did suggest that he not restart his methadone and Darvocet at this time as he is already on five different medications for his back (Celebrex, tramadol, amitriptyline, gabapentin, and the Vicodin that he was given last night). I did suggest that we could try a different anti-inflammatory if he felt that the Celebrex is not helping. The patient is agreeable to this. ASSESSMENT 1. Lumbar muscle strain. 2. Chronic back pain. PLAN: At this point in time, I felt that it was safe for the patient to transition to heat to his back which he may use as often as possible. Rx for Voltaren 75 mg tabs, dispensed 20, sig. one p.o. q.12h. for pain instead of Celebrex. He may continue with his other medications as directed but not the methadone or Darvocet. I did urge him to reschedule his pain clinic appointment as he was urged to do originally. If unimproved this week, he should follow up with Dr. Y."

Orthopedic," PREOP DIAGNOSES: 1. Left pilon fracture. 2. Left great toe proximal phalanx fracture. POSTOP DIAGNOSES: 1. Left pilon fracture. 2. Left great toe proximal phalanx fracture. OPERATION PERFORMED: 1. External fixation of left pilon fracture. 2. Closed reduction of left great toe, T1 fracture. ANESTHESIA: General. BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 mL. Needle, instrument, and sponge counts were done and correct. DRAINS AND TUBES: None. SPECIMENS: None. INDICATION FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 58-year-old female who was involved in an auto versus a tree accident on 6/15/2009. The patient suffered a fracture of a distal tibia and fibula as well as her great toe on the left side at that time. The patient was evaluated by the emergency room and did undergo further evaluation due to loss of consciousness. She underwent a provisional reduction and splinting in the emergency room followed by further evaluation for her heart and brain by the Medicine Service following this and she was appropriate for surgical intervention. Due to the comminuted nature of her tibia fracture as well as soft tissue swelling, the patient is in need of a staged surgery with the 1st stage external fixation followed by open treatment and definitive plate and screw fixation. The patient had swollen lower extremities, however, compartments were soft and she had no sign of compartment syndrome. Risks and benefits of procedure were discussed in detail with the patient and her husband. All questions were answered, and consent was obtained. The risks including damage to blood vessels and nerves with painful neuroma or numbness, limb altered function, loss of range of motion, need for further surgery, infection, complex regional pain syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were all discussed as potential risks of the surgery. FINDINGS: 1. There was a comminuted distal tibia fracture with a fibular shaft fracture. Following traction, there was adequate coronal and sagittal alignment of the fracture fragments and based on the length of the fibula, the fracture fragments were out to length. 2. The base of her proximal phalanx fracture was assessed and reduced with essentially no articular step-off and approximately 1-mm displacement. As the reduction was stable with buddy taping, no pinning was performed. 3. Her compartments were full, but not firm nor did she have any sign of compartment syndrome and no compartment releases were performed. OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL: The patient was identified in the preoperative holding area. The left leg was identified and marked at the surgical site of the patient. She was then taken to the operating room where she was transferred to the operating room in the supine position, placed under general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team. She received Ancef for antibiotic prophylaxis. A time-out was then undertaken verifying the correct patient, extremity, visibility of preoperative markings, availability of equipment, and administration of preoperative antibiotics. When all was verified by the surgeon, anesthesia and circulating personnel left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. At this point, intraoperative fluoroscopy was used to identify the fracture site as well as the appropriate starting point both in the calcaneus for a transcalcaneal cross stent and in the proximal tibia with care taken to leave enough room for later plate fixation without contaminating the future operative site. A single centrally threaded calcaneal cross tunnel was then placed across the calcaneus parallel to the joint surface followed by placement of 2 Schantz pins in the tibia and a frame type external fixator was then applied in traction with attempts to get the fracture fragments out to length, but not overly distract the fracture and restore coronal and sagittal alignment as much as able. When this was adequate, the fixator apparatus was locked in place, and x-ray images were taken verifying correct placement of the hardware and adequate alignment of the fracture. Attention was then turned to the left great toe, where a reduction of the proximal phalanx fracture was performed and buddy taping as this provided good stability and was least invasive. X-rays were taken showing good reduction of the base of the proximal phalanx of the great toe fracture. At this point, the pins were cut short and capped to protect the sharp ends. The stab wounds for the Schantz pin and cross pin were covered with gauze with Betadine followed by dry gauze, and the patient was then awakened from anesthesia and transferred to the progressive care unit in stable condition. Please note there was no break in sterile technique throughout the case. PLAN: The patient will require definitive surgical treatment in approximately 2 weeks when the soft tissues are amenable to plate and screw fixation with decreased risk of wound complication. She will maintain her buddy taping in regards to her great toe fracture."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. PROCEDURES: 1. Right open carpal tunnel release. 2. Cortisone injection, left carpal tunnel. ANESTHESIA: General LMA. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATIONS: This patient is a 50-year-old male with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, which is measured out as severe. He is scheduled for the above-mentioned procedures. The planned procedures were discussed with the patient including the associated risks. The risks included but are not limited to bleeding, infection, nerve damage, failure to heal, possible need for reoperation, possible recurrence, or any associated risk of the anesthesia. He voiced understanding and agreed to proceed as planned. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was identified in the holding area and correct operative site was identified by the surgeon's mark. Informed consent was obtained. The patient was then brought to the operating room and transferred to the operating table in supine position. Time-out was then performed at which point the surgeon, nursing staff, and anesthesia staff all confirmed the correct identification. After adequate general LMA anesthesia was obtained, a well-padded tourniquet was placed on the patient's right upper arm. The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Planned skin incision was marked along the base of the patient's right palm. Right upper extremity was then exsanguinated using Esmarch. The tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg. Skin incision was then made and dissection was carried down with scalpel to the level of the palmar fascia which was sharply divided by the skin incision. Bleeding points were identified with electrocautery using bipolar electrocautery. Retractors were then placed to allow visualization of the distal extent of the transverse carpal ligament, and this was then divided longitudinally under direct vision. Baby Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect distal to this area to confirm the absence of any remaining crossing obstructing fibrous band. Retractors were then replaced proximally to allow visualization of proximal extent of the transverse carpal ligament and the release was continued proximally until complete release was performed. This was confirmed by visually and palpably. Next, baby Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect anteroposterior adjacent antebrachial fascia, and this was divided longitudinally under direct vision using baby Metzenbaum scissors to a level of approximately 3 cm proximal to the proximal extent of the skin incision. Carpal canal was then inspected. The median nerve was flattened and injected. No other abnormalities were noted. Wounds were then irrigated with normal saline and antibiotic additive. Decadron 4 mg was then placed adjacent to the median nerve. Skin incision was then closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon suture. The wound was then dressed with Adaptic, 4 x 4s, Kling, and Coban. The tourniquet was then deflated. Attention was then directed to the left side. Using sterile technique, the left carpal canal was injected with a mixture of 40 mg of Depo-Medrol, 1 cc of 1% lidocaine, and 1 cc of 0.25% Marcaine. Band-Aid was then placed over the injection site. The patient was then awakened, extubated, and transferred over to his hospital bed. He was transported to recovery room in stable condition. There were no intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications. All counts were reported as correct."

Orthopedic," TITLE OF OPERATION: Lateral and plantar condylectomy, fifth left metatarsal. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prominent, lateral, and plantar condyle hypertrophy, fifth left metatarsal. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prominent, lateral, and plantar condyle hypertrophy, fifth left metatarsal. ANESTHESIA: Monitored anesthesia care with 10 mL of 1:1 mixture of both 0.5% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain. HEMOSTASIS: 30 minutes, left ankle tourniquet set at 250 mmHg. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 mL. MATERIALS USED: 3-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Vicryl. INJECTABLES: Ancef 1 g IV 30 minutes preoperatively. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in a supine position. After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites. The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg. The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in a normal sterile technique. The left ankle tourniquet was inflated. Attention was then directed on the dorsolateral aspect of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint where a 4-cm linear incision was placed over the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint parallel and lateral to the course of the extensor digitorum longus to the fifth left toe. The incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissues. All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized. The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint. All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved. Using sharp and dull dissection, the soft tissue attachments through the fifth left metatarsal head were mobilized. The lateral and plantar aspect of the fifth left metatarsal head were adequately exposed and using the sagittal saw a lateral and plantar condylectomy of the fifth left metatarsal head were then achieved. The bony prominences were removed and passed off the operating table to be sent to pathology for identification. The remaining sharp edges of the fifth left metatarsal head were then smoothened with the use of a dental rasp. The area was copiously flushed with saline. Then, 3-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Vicryl suture materials were used to approximate the periosteal, capsular, and subcutaneous tissues respectively. The incision was reinforced with Steri-Strips. Range of motion of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint was tested and was found to be excellent and uninhibited. The patient's left ankle tourniquet at this time was deflated. Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire left lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff. The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage and the patient's left foot was placed in a surgical shoe. The patient was then transferred to the recovery room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and her vascular status at appropriate levels. The patient was given pain medications and instructions on how to control her postoperative course. She was discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was will follow up with Dr. X in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment."

CPT code 22845: Anterior cervical instrumentation, C5-C7. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Negligible. DRAINS: Small suction drain in the cervical wound. COMPLICATIONS: None. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was given intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis and thigh-high TED hoses were placed on the lower extremities while in the preanesthesia holding area. The patient was transported to the operative suite and on to the operative table in the supine position. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced. The head was placed on a well-padded head holder. The eyes and face were protected from pressure. A well-padded roll was placed beneath the neck and shoulders to help preserve the cervical lordosis. The arms were tucked and draped to the sides. All bony prominences were well padded. An x-ray was taken to confirm the correct level of the skin incision. The anterior neck was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A straight transverse skin incision over the left side of the anterior neck was made and carried down sharply through the skin and subcutaneous tissues to the level of the platysma muscle, which was divided transversely using the electrocautery. The superficial and deep layers of the deep cervical fascia were divided. The midline structures were reflected to the right side. Care was taken during the dissection to avoid injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the usual anatomical location of that nerve was protected. The carotid sheath was palpated and protected laterally. An x-ray was taken to confirm the level of C5-C6 and C6-C7. The longus colli muscle was dissected free bilaterally from C5 to C7 using blunt dissection. Hemostasis was obtained using the electrocautery. The blades of the cervical retractor were placed deep to the longus colli muscles bilaterally. At C5-C6, the anterior longitudinal ligament was divided transversely. Straight pituitary rongeurs and a curette were used to remove the contents of the disc space. All cartilages were scraped off the inferior endplate of C5 and from the superior endplate of C6. The disc resection was carried posteriorly to the posterior longitudinal ligament and laterally to the uncovertebral joints. The posterior longitudinal ligament was resected using a 1 mm Kerrison rongeur. Beginning in the midline and extending into both neural foramen, posterior osteophytes were removed using a 1 m and a 2 mm Kerrison rongeurs. The patient was noted to have significant bony spondylosis causing canal and foraminal stenosis as well as a degenerative and protruding disc in agreement with preoperative diagnostic imaging studies. Following completion of the discectomy and osteophytectomy, a blunt nerve hook was passed into the canal superiorly and inferiorly as well as in the both neural foramen to make sure that there were no extruded disc fragments and to make sure the bony decompression was complete. A portion of the uncovertebral joint was resected bilaterally for additional nerve root decompression. Both nerve roots were visualized and noted to be free of encroachment. The same procedure was then carried out at C6-C7 with similar findings. The only difference in the findings was that at C6-C7 on the left side, the patient was found to have an extruded disc fragment in the canal and extending into the left side neural foramen causing significant cord and nerve root encroachment. In preparation for the arthrodesis, the endplates of C5, C6, and C7 were burred in a parallel fashion down to the level of bleeding bone using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling. The disc spaces were then measured to the nearest millimeter. Attention was then turned toward preparation of the structural allograft, which consisted of two pieces of pre-machined corticocancellous bone. The grafts were further shaped to fit the disc spaces exactly in a press-fit manner with approximately 1.5 mm of distraction at each disc space. The grafts were shaped to be slightly lordotic to help preserve the cervical lordosis. The grafts were impacted into the disc spaces. There was complete bony apposition between the ends of the bone grafts and the vertebral bodies of C5, C6, and C7. A blunt nerve hook was passed posterior to each bone graft to make sure that the bone grafts were in good position. Anterior osteophytes were removed using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling. An appropriate length Synthes cervical plate was selected and bent slightly to conform to the patient's cervical lordosis. The plate was held in the midline with provided instrumentation while a temporary fixation screw was applied at C6. Screw holes were then drilled using the provided drill and drill guide taking care to avoid injury to neurovascular structures. The plate was then rigidly fixed to the anterior spine using 14-mm cancellous screws followed by locking setscrews added to the head of each screw to prevent postoperative loosening of the plate and/or screws. An x-ray was taken, which confirmed satisfactory postioning of the plate, screws, and bone grafts. Blood loss was minimal. The wound was irrigated with irrigant solution containing antibiotics. The wound was inspected and judged to be dry. The wound was closed over a suction drain placed in the deepest portion of the wound by reapproximating the platysma muscle with #4-0 Vicryl running suture, the subdermal and subcuticular layers with #4-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures, and the skin with Steri-Strips. The sponge and needle count were correct. A sterile dressing was applied to the wound. The neck was placed in a cervical orthosis. The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left carpal tunnel syndrome. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left carpal tunnel syndrome. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Left carpal tunnel release. FINDINGS: Showed severe compression of the median nerve on the left at the wrist. SPECIMENS: None. FLUIDS: 500 mL of crystalloids. URINE OUTPUT: No Foley catheter. COMPLICATIONS: None. ANESTHESIA: General through a laryngeal mask. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None. CONDITION: Resuscitated with stable vital signs. INDICATION FOR THE OPERATION: This is a case of a very pleasant 65-year-old forensic pathologist who I previously had performed initially a discectomy and removal of infection at 6-7, followed by anterior cervical discectomy with anterior interbody fusion at C5-6 and C6-7 with spinal instrumentation. At the time of initial consultation, the patient was also found to have bilateral carpal tunnel and for which we are addressing the left side now. Operation, expected outcome, risks, and benefits were discussed with him for most of the risk would be that of infection because of the patient's diabetes and a previous history of infection in the form of pneumonia. There is also the possibility of bleeding as well as the possibility of injury to the median nerve on dissection. He understood this risk and agreed to have the procedure performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress. After smooth induction of anesthesia and placement of a laryngeal mask, he remained supine on the operating table. The left upper extremity was then prepped with Betadine soap and antiseptic solution. After sterile drapes were laid out, an incision was made following inflation of blood pressure cuff to 250 mmHg. Clamp time approximately 30 minutes. An incision was then made right in the mid palm area between the thenar and hypothenar eminence. Meticulous hemostasis of any bleeders were done. The fat was identified. The palmar aponeurosis was identified and cut and this was traced down to the wrist. There was severe compression of the median nerve. Additional removal of the aponeurosis was performed to allow for further decompression. After this was all completed, the area was irrigated with saline and bacitracin solution and closed as a single layer using Prolene 4-0 as interrupted vertical mattress stitches. Dressing was applied. The patient was brought to the recovery."

Orthopedic," EXAM:MRI RIGHT SHOULDER CLINICAL: A 32-year-old male with shoulder pain. FINDINGS: This is a second opinion interpretation of the examination performed on 02/16/06. Normal supraspinatus tendon without surface fraying, gap or fiber retraction and there is no muscular atrophy. Normal infraspinatus and subscapularis tendons. Normal long biceps tendon within the bicipital groove. There is no subluxation of the tendon under the transverse humeral ligament and the intracapsular portion of the tendon is normal. Normal humeral head without fracture or subluxation. There is myxoid degeneration within the superior labrum (oblique coronal images #47-48), but there is no discrete tear. The remaining portions of the labrum are normal without osseous Bankart lesion. Normal superior, middle and inferior glenohumeral ligaments. There is a persistent os acromiale, and there is minimal reactive marrow edema on both sides of the synchondrosis, suggesting that there may be instability (axial images #3 and 4). There is no diastasis of the acromioclavicular joint itself. There is mild narrowing of the subacromial space secondary to the os acromiale, in the appropriate clinical setting, this may be acting as an impinging lesion (sagittal images #56-59). Normal coracoacromial, coracohumeral and coracoclavicular ligaments. There are no effusions or masses. IMPRESSION: Changes in the superior labrum compatible with degeneration without a discrete surfacing tear. There is a persistent os acromiale, and there is reactive marrow edema on both sides of the synchondrosis suggesting instability. There is also mild narrowing of the subacromial space secondary to the os acromiale. This may be acting as an impinging lesion in the appropriate clinical setting. There is no evidence of a rotator cuff tear."
Orthopedic," ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture. SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: None. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: For complete details, please see dictated history and physical by Dr. X dated July 23, 2008. Briefly, the patient is a 10-year-old male who presented to the Hospital Emergency Department following an ATV accident. He was an unhelmeted passenger on ATV when the driver lost control and the ATV rolled over throwing the passenger and the driver approximately 5 to 10 meters. The patient denies any loss of consciousness. He was not amnestic to the event. He was taken by family members to the Iredell County Hospital, where he was initially evaluated. Due to the extent of his injuries, he was immediately transferred to Hospital Emergency Department for further evaluation. HOSPITAL COURSE: Upon arrival in the Hospital Emergency Department, he was noted to have an open left humerus fracture. No other apparent injuries. This was confirmed with radiographic imaging showing that the chest and pelvis x-rays were negative for any acute injury and that the cervical spine x-ray was negative for fracture malalignment. The left upper extremity x-ray did demonstrate an open left distal humerus fracture. The orthopedic surgery team was then consulted and upon their evaluation, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room for surgical repair of his left humerus fracture. In the operating room, the patient was prepared for an irrigation and debridement of what was determined to be an open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture. In the operating room, his upper extremity was evaluated for neurovascular status and great care was taken to preserve these structures. Throughout the duration of the procedure, the patient had a palpable distal radial pulse. The orthopedic team then completed an open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture. A wound VAC was then placed over the wound at the conclusion of the procedure. The patient tolerated this procedure well and was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for postsurgical followup and monitoring. His diet was advanced and his pain was controlled with pain medication. The day following his surgery, the patient was evaluated for a potential for closed head injury given the nature of his accident and the fact that he was not wearing a helmet during his accident. A CT of the brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial abnormalities moreover his cervical spine was radiographically and clinically cleared and his C-collar was removed at that point. Once his C spine had been cleared and the absence of a closed head injury was confirmed. The patient was then transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the General Floor bed. His clinical status continued to improve and on July 26, 2008, he was taken back to the operating room for removal of the wound VAC and closure of his left upper extremity wound. He again tolerated this procedure well on his return to the General Pediatrics Floor. Throughout his stay, there was concern for compartment syndrome due to the nature and extent of his injuries. However, frequent checks of his distal pulses indicated that he had strong peripheral pulses in the left upper extremity. Moreover, the patient had no complaints of paresthesia. There was no demonstration of pallor or pain on passive motion. There was good capillary refill to the digits of the left hand. By the date of the discharge, the patient was on a full pediatric select diet and was tolerating this well. He had no abdominal tenderness and there were no abdominal injuries on exam or radiographic studies. He was afebrile and his vital signs were stable and once cleared by Orthopedics, he was deemed appropriate for discharge. PROCEDURES DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION: 1. Irrigation and debridement of open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture (July 23, 2008). 2. Open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture (July 23, 2008). 3. Negative pressure wound dressing (July 23, 2008). 4. Irrigation and debridement of left elbow fracture (July 26, 2008). 5. CT of the brain without contrast (July 24, 2008). DISPOSITION: Home with parents. INVASIVE LINES: None. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed that he can return home with his regular diet and he was asked not to do any strenuous activities, move furniture, lift heavy objects, or use his left upper extremity. He was asked to followup with return appointment in one week to see Dr. Y in Orthopedics. Additionally, he was told to call his pediatrician, if he develops any fevers, pain, loss of sensation, loss of pulse, or discoloration of his fingers, or paleness to his hand."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Cellulitis with associated abscess, right foot. 2. Foreign body, right foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Cellulitis with associated abscess, right foot. 2. Foreign body, right foot. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Irrigation debridement. 2. Removal of foreign body of right foot. ANESTHESIA: Spinal with sedation. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. GROSS FINDINGS: Include purulent material from the abscess located in the plantar aspect of the foot between the third and fourth metatarsal heads. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old Caucasian male with a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. The patient states that he was working in his garage over the past few days when he noticed some redness and edema in his right foot. He notes some itching as well as increasing pain and redness in the right foot and presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room. He was evaluated by the Emergency Room staff as well as the medical team and the Department of Orthopedics. It was noted upon x-ray a foreign body in his foot and he had significant amount of cellulitis as well ________ right lower extremity. After a long discussion held with the patient, it was elected to proceed with irrigation debridement and removal of the foreign body. PROCEDURE: After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedures were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained. The operative extremity was then confirmed with the patient, operative surgeon, the Department of Anesthesia and nursing staff. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to Operative Suite #5 and placed on the operating table in supine position. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. The Department of Anesthesia was administered spinal anesthetic to the patient. Once this anesthesia was obtained, the patient's right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Upon viewing of the plantar aspect of the foot, there was noted to be a swollen ecchymotic area with a small hole in it, which purulent fluid was coming from. At this time, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified as well as the localization of the pus, a 2 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this area, which was located between the second and third metatarsal heads. Upon incising this, there was a foul smelling purulent fluid, which flowed from this region. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were taken as well as gram stain. The area was explored and it ________ to the dorsum of the foot. There was no obvious joint involvement. After all loculations were broken, 3 liters antibiotic-impregnated fluid were pulse-evac through the wound. The wound was again inspected with no more gross purulent or necrotic appearing tissue. The wound was then packed with an iodoform gauge and a sterile dressing was applied consisting of 4x4s, floss, and Kerlix covered by an Ace bandage. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to Postanesthesia Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications. DISPOSITION: The patient will be followed on a daily basis for possible repeat irrigation debridement."

Orthopedic, EXAM:MRI OF THE LEFT KNEE WITHOUT CONTRAST CLINICAL:Left knee pain. Twisting injury. FINDINGS: The images reveal a sizable joint effusion. The joint effusion appears to be complex with mixed signal intensity material within. The patella is slightly laterally tilted towards the left. The mid portion of the patella cartilage shows some increased signal and focal injury to the patellar cartilage is suspected. Mildly increased bone signal overlying the inferolateral portion of the patella is identified. No significant degenerative changes about the patella can be seen. The quadriceps tendon as well as the infrapatellar ligament both look intact. There is some prepatellar soft tissue edema. The bone signal shows a couple of small areas of cystic change in the proximal aspect of the tibia. NO significant areas of bone edema are appreciated. There is soft tissue edema along the lateral aspect of the knee. There is a partial tear of the lateral collateral ligament complex. The medial collateral ligament complex looks intact. A small amount of edema is identified immediately adjacent to the medial collateral ligament complex. The posterior cruciate ligament looks intact. The anterior cruciate ligament is thickened with significant increased signal. I suspect at least a high grade partial tear. The posterior horn of the medial meniscus shows some myxoid degenerative changes. The posterior horn and anterior horn of the lateral meniscus likewise shows myxoid degenerative type changes. I don�t see a definite tear extending to the articular surface. IMPRESSION: Sizeable joint effusion which is complex and may contain blood products. Myxoid degenerative type changes medial and lateral meniscus with no definite evidence of a tear. Soft tissue swelling and partial tear of the lateral collateral ligament complex. At least high grade partial tear of the anterior cruciate ligament with significant thickening and increased signal of this structure. The posterior cruciate ligament is intact. Injury to the patellar cartilage as above.
Orthopedic," CC: Weakness. HX: This 30 y/o RHM was in good health until 7/93, when he began experiencing RUE weakness and neck pain. He was initially treated by a chiropractor and, after an unspecified length of time, developed atrophy and contractures of his right hand. He then went to a local neurosurgeon and a cervical spine CT scan, 9/25/92, revealed an intramedullary lesion at C2-3 and an extramedullary lesion at C6-7. He underwent a C6-T1 laminectomy with exploration and decompression of the spinal cord. His clinical condition improved over a 3 month post-operative period, and then progressively worsened. He developed left sided paresthesia and upper extremity weakness (right worse than left). He then developed ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hyperreflexia. On 8/31/93, MRI C-spine showed diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa. On 9/1/93, he underwent suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy which was consistent with hemangioblastoma. His symptoms stabilized and he underwent 5040 cGy in 28 fractions to his brain and 3600 cGy in 20 fractions to his cervical and thoracic spinal cord from 9/93 through 1/19/94. He was evaluated in the NeuroOncology clinic on 10/26/95 for consideration of chemotherapy. He complained of progressive proximal weakness of all four extremities and dysphagia. He had difficulty putting on his shirt and raising his arms, and he had been having increasing difficulty with manual dexterity (e.g. unable to feed himself with utensils). He had difficulty going down stairs, but could climb stairs. He had no bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. MEDS: none. PMH: see above. FHX: Father with Von Hippel-Lindau Disease. SHX: retired truck driver. smokes 1-3 packs of cigarettes per day, but denied alcohol use. He is divorced and has two sons who are healthy. He lives with his mother. ROS: noncontributory. EXAM: Vital signs were unremarkable. MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech fluent and without dysarthria. Thought process lucid and appropriate. CN: unremarkable exept for 4+/4+ strength of the trapezeii. No retinal hemangioblastoma were seen. MOTOR: 4-/4- strength in proximal and distal upper extremities. There is diffuse atrophy and claw-hands, bilaterally. He is unable to manipulate hads to any great extent. 4+/4+ strength throughout BLE. There is also diffuse atrophy throughout the lower extremities though not as pronounced as in the upper extremities. SENSORY: There was a right T3 and left T8 cord levels to PP on the posterior thorax. Decreased LT in throughout the 4 extremities. COORD: difficult to assess due to weakness. Station: BUE pronator drift. Gait: stands without assistance, but can only manage to walk a few steps. Spastic gait. Reflexes: Hyperreflexic on left (3+) and Hyporeflexic on right (1). Babinski signs were present bilaterally. Gen exam: unremarkable. COURSE: 9/8/95, GS normal. By 11/14/95, he required NGT feeding due to dysphagia and aspiration risk confirmed on cookie swallow studies.MRI Brain, 2/19/96, revealed several lesions (hemangioblastoma) in the cerebellum and brain stem. There were postoperative changes and a cyst in the medulla. On 10/25/96, he presented with a 1.5 week h/o numbness in BLE from the mid- thighs to his toes, and worsening BLE weakness. He developed decubitus ulcers on his buttocks. He also had had intermittent urinary retention for month, chronic SOB and dysphagia. He had been sitting all day long as he could not move well and had no daytime assistance. His exam findings were consistent with his complaints. He had had no episodes of diaphoresis, headache, or elevated blood pressures. An MRI of the C-T spine, 10/26/96, revealed a prominent cervicothoracic syrinx extending down to T10. There was evidence of prior cervical laminectomy of C6-T1 with expansion of the cord in the thecalsac at that region. Multiple intradural extra spinal nodular lesions (hyperintense on T2, isointense on T1, enhanced gadolinium) were seen in the cervical spine and cisterna magna. The largest of which measures 1.1 x 1.0 x 2.0cm. There are also several large ring enhancing lesions in cerebellum. The lesions were felt to be consistent with hemangioblastoma. No surgical or medical intervention was initiated. Visiting nursing was provided. He has since been followed by his local physician"
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Stenosing tendinosis, right thumb (trigger finger). POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Stenosing tendinosis, right thumb (trigger finger). PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Release of A1 pulley, right thumb. ANESTHESIA: IV regional with sedation. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. TOURNIQUET TIME: Approximately 20 minutes at 250 mmHg. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: There was noted to be thickening of the A1 pulley. There was a fibrous nodule noted within the flexor tendon of the thumb, which caused triggering sensation to the thumb. HISTORY: This is a 51-year-old right hand dominant female with a longstanding history of pain as well as locking sensation to her right thumb. She was actually able to spontaneously trigger the thumb. She was diagnosed with stenosing tendinosis and wishes to proceed with release of A1 pulley. All risks and benefits of the surgery was discussed with her at length. She was in agreement with the above treatment plan. PROCEDURE: On 08/21/03, she was taken to operating room at ABCD General Hospital and placed supine on the operating table. A regional anesthetic was applied by the Anesthesia Department. Tourniquet was placed on her proximal arm. The upper extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. An incision was made over the proximal crease of the thumb. Subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected. Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery. The nerves were identified and retracted throughout the entire procedure. The fibers of the A1 pulley were identified. They were sharply dissected to release the tendon. The tendon was then pulled up into the wound and inspected. There was no evidence of gross tear noted. Fibrous nodule was noted within the tendon itself. There was no evidence of continuous locking. Once release of the pulley had been performed, the wound was copiously irrigated. It was then reapproximated using #5-0 nylon simple interrupted and horizontal mattress sutures. Sterile dressing was applied to the upper extremity. Tourniquet was deflated. It was noted that the thumb was warm and pink with good capillary refill. The patient was transferred to Recovery in apparent stable and satisfactory condition. Prognosis is fair."
Orthopedic," OPERATION PERFORMED: Ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition arthroplasty of right wrist. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: With the patient under adequate anesthesia, the right upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner. Attention was turned to the base of the thumb where a longitudinal incision was made over the anatomic snuffbox and extended out onto the carpometacarpal joint. Using blunt dissection radial sensory nerve was dissected and retracted out of the operative field. Further blunt dissection exposed the radial artery, which was dissected and retracted off the trapezium. An incision was then made across the scaphotrapezial joint distally onto the trapezium and out onto the carpometacarpal joint. Sharp dissection exposed the trapezium, which was then morselized and removed in toto with care taken to protect the underlying flexor carpi radialis tendon. The radial beak of the trapezoid was then osteotomized off the head of the scaphoid. The proximal metacarpal was then fenestrated with a 4.5-mm drill bit. Four fingers proximal to the flexion crease of the wrist a small incision was made over the FCR tendon and blunt dissection delivered the FCR tendon into this incision. The FCR tendon was divided and this incision was closed with 4-0 nylon sutures. Attention was returned to the trapezial wound where longitudinal traction on the FCR tendon delivered the FCR tendon into the wound. The FCR tendon was then threaded through the fenestration in the metacarpal. A bone anchor was then placed distal to the metacarpal fenestration. The FCR tendon was then pulled distally and the metacarpal reduced to an anatomic position. The FCR tendon was then sutured to the metacarpal using the previously placed bone anchor. Remaining FCR tendon was then anchovied and placed into the scaphotrapezoidal and trapezial defect. The MP joint was brought into extension and the capsule closed using interrupted 3-0 Tycron sutures. Attention was turned to the MCP joint where the MP joint was brought in to 15 degrees of flexion and pinned with a single 0.035 Kirschner wire. The pin was cut at the level of the skin. All incisions were closed with running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch. Sterile dressings were then applied. The tourniquet was deflated. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well."
Orthopedic," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 38-year-old woman presenting to our clinic for the first time for evaluation of hip pain, right greater than left, of greater than 2 years duration. The patient states that she began with right hip pain getting steadily worse over the last 2 years and has now developed some pain in the left hip. The pain is located laterally as well as anteriorly into the groin. She states that the pain is present during activities such as walking, and she does get some painful popping and clicking in the right hip. She is here for evaluation for the first time. She sought no previous medical attention for this. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for depression and reflux disease. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Cesarean section x 2. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Listed in the chart and reviewed with the patient. ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married. She is employed as an office manager. She does smoke cigarettes, one pack per day for the last 20 years. She consumes alcohol 3 to 5 drinks daily. She uses no illicit drugs. She exercises monthly mainly walking and low impact aerobics. She also likes to play softball. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Significant for occasional indigestion and nausea as well as anxiety and depression. The remainder of the systems negative. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is 5 foot, 2 inches tall, weighs 155 pounds. The patient ambulates independently without an assist device with normal stance and gait. Inspection of the hips reveals normal contour and appearance and good symmetry. The patient is able to do an active straight leg raise against gravity and against resistance bilaterally. She has no significant trochanteric tenderness. She does, however, have some tenderness in the groin bilaterally. There is no crepitus present with passive or active range of motion of the hips. She is grossly neurologically intact in the bilateral lower extremities. DIAGNOSTIC DATA: X-rays performed today in the clinic include an AP view of the pelvis and a frog-leg lateral of the right hip. There are no acute findings. No fractures or dislocations. There are minimal degenerative changes noted in the joint. There is, however, the suggestion of an exostosis on the superior femoral neck, which could be consistent with femoroacetabular impingement. IMPRESSION: Bilateral hip pain, right worse than left, possibly suggesting femoroacetabular impingement based on x-rays and her clinical picture is also consistent with possible labral tear. PLAN: After discussing possible diagnoses with the patient, I have recommended that we get MRI arthrograms of the bilateral hips to evaluate the anatomy and especially concentrating on the labrum in the right hip. We will get that done as soon as possible. In the meantime, she is asked to moderate her activities. She will follow up as soon as the MRIs are performed."

Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Closed displaced probable pathological fracture, basicervical femoral neck, left hip. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Closed displaced probable pathological fracture, basicervical femoral neck, left hip. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Left hip cemented hemiarthroplasty. 2. Biopsy of the tissue from the fracture site and resected femoral head sent to the pathology for further assessment. IMPLANTS USED: 1. DePuy Ultima calcar stem, size 3 x 45. 2. Bipolar head 28 x 43. 3. Head with +0 neck length. 4. Distal centralizer and cement restrictor. 5. SmartSet antibiotic cement x2. ANESTHESIA: General. NEEDLE AND SPONGE COUNT: Correct. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 300 mL. SPECIMEN: Resected femoral head and tissue from the fracture site as well as the marrow from the canal. FINDINGS: On exposure, the fracture was noted to be basicervical pattern with no presence of calcar about the lesser trochanter. The lesser trochanter was intact. The fracture site was noted to show abnormal pathological tissue with grayish discoloration. The quality of the bone was also pathologically abnormal with soft trabecular bone. The abnormal pathological tissues were sent along with the femoral head to pathology for assessment. Articular cartilage of the acetabulum was intact and well preserved. INDICATION: The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of malignant melanoma, who apparently had severe pain in her left lower extremity and was noted to have a basicervical femoral neck fracture. She denied any history of fall or trauma. The presentation was consistent with pathological fracture pending tissue assessment. Indication, risks, and benefits were discussed. Treatment options were reviewed. No guarantees have been made or implied. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and once an adequate general anesthesia was achieved, she was positioned on a pegboard with the left side up. The left lower extremity was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion. Time-out procedure was called. Antibiotics were infused. A standard posterolateral approach was made. Subcutaneous dissection was performed and the dissection was carried down to expose the fascia of the gluteus maximus. This was then incised along the line of the incision. Hemostasis was achieved. Charnley retractor was positioned. The trochanter was intact. The gluteus medius was well protected with retractor. The piriformis and minimus junction was identified. The minimus was also reflected along with the medius. Using Bovie and knife, the piriformis and external rotators were detached from its trochanteric insertion. Similarly, L-shaped capsulotomy was performed. A #5 Ethibond was utilized to tag the piriformis and the capsule for late repair. Fracture site was exposed. The femoral neck fracture was noted to be very low-lying basicervical type. Femoral head was retrieved without any difficulty with the help of a corkscrew. The head size was measured to be 43 mm. Bony fragments were removed. The acetabular socket was thoroughly irrigated. A 43-mm bipolar trial head was inserted and this was noted to give a satisfactory fit with good stability. The specimens submitted to pathology included the resected femoral head and the tissue at the fracture site, which was abnormal with grayish discoloration. This was sent to the pathology. The fracture was noted to be basicervical and preoperatively, decision was made to consider cemented calcar stem. An L-shaped osteotomy was performed in order to accept the calcar prosthesis. The basicervical fracture was noted to be just at the level of superior border of the lesser trochanter. There was no calcar superior to the lesser trochanter. The L-shaped osteotomy was performed to refine the bony edges and accept the calcar prosthesis. Hemostasis was achieved. Now, the medullary canal was entered with a canal finder. The fracture site was well exposed. Satisfactory lateralization was performed. Attention was for the reaming process. Using a size 1 reamer, the medullary canal was entered and reamed up to size 3, which gave us a satisfactory fit into the canal. At this point, a trial prosthesis size 3 with 45 mm calcar body was inserted. Appropriate anteversion was positioned. The anteversion was marked with a Bovie to identify subsequent anteversion during implantation. The bony edges were trimmed. The calcar implant with 45 mm neck length was fit in the host femur very well. There was no evidence of any subsidence. At this point, trial reduction was performed using a bipolar trial head with 0 neck length. The relationship between the central femoral head and the greater trochanter was satisfactory. The hip was well reduced without any difficulty. The stability and range of motion in extension and external rotation as well as flexion-adduction, internal rotation was satisfactory. The shuck was less than 1 mm. Leg length was satisfactory in reference to the contralateral leg. Stability was satisfactory at 90 degrees of flexion and hip at 75-80 degrees of internal rotation. Similarly, keeping the leg completely adducted, I was able to internally rotate the hip to 45 degrees. After verifying the stability and range of motion in all direction, trial components were removed. The canal was thoroughly irrigated and dry sponge was inserted and canal was dried completely. At this point, 2 batches of SmartSet cement with antibiotics were mixed. The definitive Ultima calcar stem size 3 with 45 mm calcar body was selected. Centralizer was positioned. The cement restrictor was inserted. Retrograde cementing technique was applied once the canal was dried. Using cement gun, retrograde cementing was performed. The stem was then inserted into cemented canal with appropriate anteversion, which was maintained until the cement was set hard and cured. The excess cement was removed with the help of a curette and Freer elevator. All the cement debris was removed. Attention was now placed for the insertion of the trial femoral head. Once again, 0 neck length trial bipolar head was inserted over the trunnion. It was reduced and range of motion and stability was satisfactory. I also attempted with a -3 trial head, but the 0 gave us a satisfactory stability, range of motion, as well as the length and the shuck was also minimal. The hip was raised to 90 degrees of flexion and 95 degrees of internal rotation. There was no evidence of any impingement on extension and external rotation as well as flexion-adduction, internal rotation. I also tested the hip at 90 degrees of flexion with 10 degrees adduction and internal rotation and further progressive flexion of the hip beyond 90 degrees, which was noted to be very stable. At this point, a definitive component using +0 neck length and bipolar 43 head were placed over the trunnion and the hip was reduced. Range of motion and stability was as above. Now, the attention was placed for the repair of the capsule and the external rotators and the piriformis. This was repaired to the trochanteric insertion using #5 Ethibond and suture plaster. Satisfactory reinforcement was achieved with the #5 Ethibond. The wound was thoroughly irrigated. Hemostasis was achieved. The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure using 2-0 Vicryl. The wound was thoroughly washed and a local injection with mixture of morphine and Toradol was infiltrated including the capsule and the pericapsular structures. Skin was approximated with staples. Sterile dressings were placed. Abduction pillow was positioned and the patient was then extubated and transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition. There were no intraoperative complications noted."
Orthopedic," DIAGNOSIS: Ankle sprain, left ankle. HISTORY: The patient is a 31-year-old female who was referred to Physical Therapy secondary to a fall on 10/03/08. The patient states that she tripped over her dog toy and fell with her left foot inverted. The patient states that she received a series of x-rays and MRIs that were unremarkable. After approximately 1 month, the patient continued to have significant debilitating pain in her left ankle. She then received a walking boot and has been in the boot for the past month. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension, asthma, and cervical cancer. The cervical cancer was diagnosed as 15 years old. The patient states that her cancer is &quot;dormant.&quot; MEDICATIONS: 1. Hydrochlorothiazide. 2. Lisinopril. 3. Percocet. The patient states that the Percocet helps to take the edge of her pain, but does not completely eliminate it. SUBJECTIVE: The patient rates the pain at 2/10 on the pain analog scale. The patient states that with elevation and rest, her pain subsides. FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES/HOBBIES: Currently limited including basic household chores and activities, this does increases her pain. The patient states she also recently joined Weight Watchers and was involved in a walking routine and is currently unable to participate in this activity. WORK STATUS: The patient is currently on medical leave as a paraprofessional. The patient states that she works as a teacher's aide in the school system and is required to complete extensive walking and standing activities. The patient states that she is primarily on her feet while at work and rarely has a sitting break for extensive period of time. The patient's goal is to be able to stand and walk without pain. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in a private home with children and her father. The patient states that she does have stairs to negotiate without the use of a railing. She states that she is able to manage the stairs, however, is very slow with her movement. The patient smokes 1-1/2 packs of cigarettes a day and does not have a history of regular exercise routine. OBJECTIVE: Upon observation, the patient is a very obese female who is ambulating with significant antalgic gait pattern and altered normal gait due to the pain as well as the walking boot. Upon inspection of the left ankle, it appears to have swelling, unsure if this swelling is secondary to injury or water retention as the patient states she has significant water retention. When compared to right ankle edema, it is approximately equal. There is no evidence of discoloration or temperature. The patient states that she had no bruising at the time of injury. Active range of motion of left ankle is as follows: Dorsiflexion is 6 degrees past neutral and plantar flexion is 54 degrees, eversion 20 degrees, and inversion is 30 degrees. Left ankle dorsiflexion lacks 10 degrees from neutral and plantar flexion is 36 degrees, this motion is very painful. The patient was tearful during this activity. Eversion is 3 degrees and inversion is 25 degrees. The patient states this movement was difficult, but not painful. Strength testing of the right lower extremity is grossly 4+-5/5 and left ankle is 2/5 as the patient is unable to obtain full range of motion. PALPATION: The patient is very tender to palpation primarily along the lateral malleolus of the left ankle. JOINT PLAY: Unable to be assessed secondary to the patient's extreme tenderness and guarding of the ankle joint. SPECIAL TESTS: A 6-minute walk test. The patient was able to ambulate approximately 600 feet while wearing her walking boot prior to her pain significantly increasing in the ankle and requiring the test to be stopped. ASSESSMENT: The patient would benefit from skilled physical therapy intervention as a trial of treatment in order to address the following problem list: 1. Increased pain. 2. Decreased range of motion. 3. Decreased strength. 4. Decreased ability to complete work task and functional activities in the home. 5. Decreased gait pattern. SHORT-TERM GOALS TO BE COMPLETED IN 3 WEEKS: 1. The patient will demonstrate independence with home exercise program. 2. The patient will ambulate without her boot for 48 hours in order to decrease reliance upon the boot for ankle stabilization. 3. The patient will achieve left ankle dorsiflexion to neutral and plantar flexion to 45 degrees without significant increase in pain. 4. The patient will demonstrate 3/5 strength of the left ankle. 5. The patient will tolerate the completion of the 6-minute walk test without the use of a boot with minimal increase in pain. LONG-TERM GOALS TO BE COMPLETED IN 6 WEEKS: 1. The patient will report 0/10 pain in the 48-hour period without the use of medication and without wearing her boot. 2. The patient will return to go through the work without the use of the walking boot with report of minimal increase in pain and discomfort. PROGNOSIS: Fair for above-stated goals with full compliance to home exercise program and therapy treatment as well as the patient motivation. PLAN: The patient to be seen three times a week for 6 weeks for the following: 1. Therapeutic exercise with home exercise program in order to improve active range of motion and strength as functional activities. 2. Modalities to include ice and heat. 3. Manual therapy to include joint mobilization and soft tissue mobilization as tolerated. 4. Gait training in order to regain normal gait pattern and avoid any increase in additional joint involvement. I have explained the findings and the plan of care with the patient. The patient states she understands and agrees to comply with treatment and plan of care."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Torn lateral meniscus, right knee. 2. Chondromalacia of the patella, right knee. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Torn lateral meniscus, right knee. 2. Chondromalacia of the patella, right knee. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Arthroscopic lateral meniscoplasty. 2. Patellar shaving of the right knee. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: Zero. GROSS FINDINGS: A complex tear involving the lateral and posterior horns of the lateral meniscus and grade-II chondromalacia of the patella. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 45-year-old Caucasian male presented to the office complaining of right knee pain. He complained of pain on the medial aspect of his right knee after an injury at work, which he twisted his right knee. PROCEDURE: After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedures were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained. The operative extremity was then confirmed with the operative surgeon, the patient, the Department of Anesthesia and the nursing staff. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to Operative Suite #2, placed on the operating table in supine position. Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. The right lower extremity was then properly positioned in a Johnson knee holder. At this time, 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 20 cc was administered to the right knee intra-articularly under sterile conditions. The right lower extremity was then sterilely prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Next, after all bony soft tissue landmarks were identified, an inferolateral working portal was established by making a 1-cm transverse incision at the level of the joint line lateral to the patellar tendon. The cannula and trocar were then inserted through this, putting the patellofemoral joint. An arthroscopic camera was then inserted and the knee was sequentially examined including the patellofemoral joint, the medial and lateral gutters, medial lateral joints, and the femoral notch. Upon viewing of the patellofemoral joint, there was noted to be grade-II chondromalacia changes of the patella. There were no loose bodies noted in the either gutter. Upon viewing of the medial compartment, there was no chondromalacia or meniscal tear was noted. While in this area, attention was directed to establish the inferomedial instrument portal. This was first done using a spinal needle for localization followed by 1-cm transverse incision at the joint line. A probe was then inserted through this portal and the meniscus was further probed. Again, there was noted to be no meniscal tear. The knee was taken through range of motion and there was no chondromalacia. Upon viewing of the femoral notch, there was noted to be intact ACL with negative drawer sign. PCL was also noted to be intact. Upon viewing of the lateral compartment, there was noted to be a large bucket-handle tear involving the lateral and posterior horns. It was reduced from the place, however, involved the white and red white area was elected to excise the bucket-handle. An arthroscopic scissor was then inserted and the two remaining attachments the posterior and lateral attachments were then clipped and a Schlesinger grasper was then used to remove the resected meniscus. It was noted that the meniscus was followed out to the whole and the entire piece was taken out of the knee. Pictures were taken both pre-meniscal resection and post-meniscal resection. The arthroscopic shaver was then inserted into the medial portal and the remaining meniscus was contoured. The lateral gutter was then examined and was noted to be no loose bodies and ______ was intact. Next, attention was directed to the inner surface of the patella. This was debrided using the 2.5 arthroscopic shaver. It was noted to be quite smooth and postprocedure the patient was taken ________ well. The knee was then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry and all instrumentation was removed. 20 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was then administered to each portal as well as intra-articularly. Sterile dressing was then applied consisting of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and sterile Webril and a stockinette to the right lower extremity. At this time, Department of Anesthesia reversed the anesthetic. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to the Postanesthesia Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure and there were no complications."
Orthopedic," REASON FOR VISIT: Kyphosis. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 13-year-old new patient is here for evaluation of thoracic kyphosis. The patient has a family history in a maternal aunt and grandfather of kyphosis. She was noted by her parents to have round back posture. They have previously seen another orthopedist who recommended observation at this time. She is here for a second opinion in regards to kyphosis. The patient denies any pain in her back or any numbness, tingling, or weakness in her upper or lower extremities. No problems with her bowels or bladder. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: None. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Bilateral pinning of her ears. SOCIAL HISTORY: She is currently an eighth grader at Middle School and is interested in basketball. She lives with both of her parents and has a 9-year-old brother. She had menarche beginning in September. FAMILY HISTORY: Of kyphosis in great grandmother and second cousin. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She is in her usual state of health and is negative except otherwise as mentioned in the history of present illness. MEDICATIONS: She is currently on Zyrtec, Flonase, and Ceftin for an ear infection. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. FINDINGS: On physical exam, she is alert, oriented, and in no acute distress standing 63 inches tall. In regards to her back, her skin is intact with no rashes, lesions, and/or no dimpling or hair spots. No cafe au lait spots. She is not tender to palpation from her occiput to her sacrum. There is no evidence of paraspinal muscle spasm. On forward bending, there is a mild kyphosis. She is not able to touch her toes indicating her hamstring tightness. She has a full 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups. Her lower extremities including iliopsoas, quadriceps, gastroc-soleus, tibialis anterior, and extensor hallucis longus. Her sensation intact to light touch in L1 through L2 dermatomal distributions. She has symmetric limb lengths as well bilaterally from both the coronal and sagittal planes. X-rays today included PA and lateral sclerosis series. She has approximately 46 degree kyphosis. ASSESSMENT: Kyphosis. PLANS: The patient's kyphosis is quite mild. While this is likely in the upper limits of normal or just it is normal for an adolescent and still within normal range as would be expected return at home. At this time, three options were discussed with the parents including observation, physical therapy, and bracing. At this juncture, given that she has continued to grow, they are Risser 0. She may benefit from continued observation with physical therapy, bracing would be a more aggressive option certainly that thing would be lost with following at this time. As such, she was given a prescription for physical therapy for extension based strengthening exercises, flexibility range of motion exercises, postural training with no forward bending. We will see her back in 3 months' time for repeat radiographs at that time including PA and lateral standing of scoliosis series. Should she show evidence of continued progression of her kyphotic deformity, discussions of bracing would be held at time. We will see her back in 3 months' time for repeat evaluation."
Orthopedic," EXAM: Thoracic Spine. REASON FOR EXAM: Injury. INTERPRETATION: The thoracic spine was examined in the AP, lateral and swimmer's projections. There is mild chronic-appearing anterior wedging of what is believed to represent T11 and 12 vertebral bodies. A mild amount of anterior osteophytic lipping is seen involving the thoracic spine. There is a suggestion of generalized osteoporosis. The intervertebral disc spaces appear generally well preserved. The pedicles appear intact. IMPRESSION: 1. Mild chronic-appearing anterior wedging of what is believed to represent the T11 and 12 vertebral bodies. 2. Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine. 3. Osteoporosis."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: C5-C6 disc herniation with right arm radiculopathy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: C5-C6 disc herniation with right arm radiculopathy. PROCEDURE: 1. C5-C6 arthrodesis, anterior interbody technique. 2. C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy. 3. C5-C6 anterior instrumentation with a 23-mm Mystique plate and the 13-mm screws. 4. Implantation of machine bone implant. 5. Microsurgical technique. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 100 mL. BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SURGICAL INDICATIONS: The patient is a 45-year-old right-handed gentleman who presented with neck and right arm radicular pain. The pain has become more and more severe. It runs to the thumb and index finger of the right hand and it is accompanied by numbness. If he tilts his neck backwards, the pain shoots down the arm. If he is working with the computer, it is very difficult to use his mouse. He tried conservative measures and failed to respond, so he sought out surgery. Surgery was discussed with him in detail. A C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was recommended. He understood and wished to proceed with surgery. Thus, he was brought in same day for surgery on 07/03/2007. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: He was given Ancef 1 g intravenously for infection prophylaxis and then transported to the OR. There general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. He was positioned on the OR table with an IV bag between the scapulae. The neck was slightly extended and taped into position. A metal arch was placed across the neck and intraoperative x-ray was obtain to verify a good position for skin incision and the neck was prepped with Betadine and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A linear incision was created in the neck beginning just to the right of the midline extending out across the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The incision was extended through skin, subcutaneous fat, and platysma. Hemostasis was assured with Bovie cautery. The anterior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was identified and dissection was carried medial to this down to the carotid sheath. The trachea and the esophagus were swept out of the way and dissection proceeded medial to the carotid sheath down between the two bellies of the longus colli muscle on to the anterior aspect of the spine. A Bovie cautery was used to mobilize the longus colli muscle around initially what turned out to be C6-C7 disk based on x-rays and then around the C5-C6 disk space. An intraoperative x-ray confirmed C5-C6 disk space had been localized and then the self-retained distraction system was inserted to maintain exposure. A 15-blade knife was used to incise the C5-C6 disk and remove disk material. and distraction pins were inserted into C5-C6 and distraction placed across the disk space. The operating microscope was then brought into the field and used throughout the case except for the closure. Various pituitaries, #15 blade knife, and curette were used to evacuate the disk as best as possible. Then, the Midas Rex drill was taken under the microscope and used to drill where the cartilaginous endplate driven back all the way into the posterior aspect of the vertebral body. A nerve hook was swept underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and a fragment of disk was produced and was pulled up through the ligament. A Kerrison rongeur was used to open up the ligament in this opening and then to march out in the both neural foramina. A small amount of disk material was found at the right neural foramen. After a good decompression of both neural foramina was obtained and the thecal sac was exposed throughout the width of the exposure, the wound was thoroughly irrigated. A spacing mechanism was intact into the disk space and it was determined that a #7 spacer was appropriate. So, a #7 machine bone implant was taken and tapped into disk space and slightly counter sunk. The wound was thoroughly irrigated and inspected for hemostasis. A Mystique plate 23 mm in length was then inserted and anchored to the anterior aspect of C5-C6 to hold the bone into position and the wound was once again irrigated. The patient was valsalved. There was no further bleeding seen and intraoperative x-ray confirmed a good position near the bone, plate, and screws and the wound was enclosed in layers. The 3-0 Vicryl was used to approximate platysma and 3-0 Vicryl was used in inverted interrupted fashion to perform a subcuticular closure of the skin. The wound was cleaned. Mastisol was placed on the skin, and Steri-strips were used to approximate skin margins. Sterile dressing was placed on the patient's neck. He was extubated in the OR and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. There were no complications."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: History of compartment syndrome, right lower extremity, status post 4 compartments fasciotomy, to do incision for compartment fasciotomy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: History of compartment syndrome, right lower extremity, status post 4 compartments fasciotomy, to do incision for compartment fasciotomy. OPERATIONS: 1. Wound debridement x2, including skin, subcutaneous, and muscle. 2. Insertion of tissue expander to the medial wound. 3. Insertion of tissue expander to the lateral wound. COMPLICATIONS: None. TOURNIQUET: None. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: This patient developed a compartment syndrome. She underwent 4 compartment fasciotomy with dual incision on medial and lateral aspect of the right lower leg. She was doing very well and was obviously improving. The swelling was reduced. A compartment pressure had obviously improved based on examination. She was therefore indicated for placement of tissue expander for ventral wound closure. The risks of procedure as well as alternatives of this procedure were discussed at length with the patient and he understood them well. Risks and benefits were all discussed, risk of bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgery, chronic pain with range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed. She understood them well. All questions were answered, and she signed the consent for the procedure as described. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved. The medial wound was noted to be approximately 10.5 cm in length x 4 cm. The lateral wound was noted in approximately 14 cm in length x 5 x 5 cm in width. Both wounds were then thoroughly debrided. The debridement of both wounds included skin and subcutaneous tissue and nonviable muscle portion. This involve very small portion of muscle as well as skin edge and the subcutaneous tissue did require debridement on both sides. At this point adequate debridement was performed and healthy tissue did appear to be present. Initially on the medial wound I did place the DermaClose RC continuous external tissue expander. On the medial wound the 5 skin anchors were placed on each side of the wound and separated appropriately. I then did place the line loop from the tension controller in a lace like manner through the skin anchors and the tension controller was attached to the middle anchor. I then did place adequate tension on the sutures. Continued tension will be noted after engaging the tension controller. At this point I performed the similar procedure to the lateral wound. The skin anchors were placed separately and appropriately on either side of the skin margin. The line loop from the tension controller was placed in lace like manner through the skin anchors. The tension controller was then attached to the mid anchor and appropriate tension was applied. It must be noted I did undermine the skin edges both sides of flap from both incision site prior to placement of the skin anchor and adequate mobilization was obtained. Adequate tension was placed in this region. A non thick dressing was then applied to the open-wound region and sterile dressing was then applied. No complications were encountered throughout the procedure and the patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition."
Orthopedic," REASON FOR VISIT: Followup status post L4-L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and L4-L5 posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. ABC returns today for followup status post L4-L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and posterior spinal fusion on 06/08/07. Preoperatively, her symptoms, those of left lower extremity are radicular pain. She had not improved immediately postoperatively. She had a medial breech of a right L4 pedicle screw. We took her back to the operating room same night and reinserted the screw. Postoperatively, her pain had improved. I had last seen her on 06/28/07 at which time she was doing well. She had symptoms of what she thought was &quot;restless leg syndrome&quot; at that time. She has been put on ReQuip for this. She returned. I had spoken to her 2 days ago and she had stated that her right lower extremity pain was markedly improved. I had previously evaluated this for a pain possibly relating to deep venous thrombosis and ultrasound was negative. She states that she had recurrent left lower extremity pain, which was similar to the pain she had preoperatively but in a different distribution, further down the leg. Thus, I referred her for a lumbar spine radiograph and lumbar spine MRI and she presents today for evaluation. She states that overall, she is improved compared to preoperatively. She is ambulating better than she was preoperatively. The pain is not as severe as it was preoperatively. The right leg pain is improved. The left lower extremity pain is in a left L4 and L5 distribution radiating to the great toe and first web space on the left side. She denies any significant low back pain. No right lower extremity symptoms. No infectious symptoms whatsoever. No fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath. No drainage from the wound. No difficulties with the incision. FINDINGS: On examination, Ms. ABC is a pleasant, well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress. Alert and oriented x 3. Normocephalic, atraumatic. Respirations are normal and nonlabored. Afebrile to touch. Left tibialis anterior strength is 3 out of 5, extensor hallucis strength is 2 out of 5. Gastroc-soleus strength is 3 to 4 out of 5. This has all been changed compared to preoperatively. Motor strength is otherwise 4 plus out of 5. Light touch sensation decreased along the medial aspect of the left foot. Straight leg raise test normal bilaterally. The incision is well healed. There is no fluctuance or fullness with the incision whatsoever. No drainage. Radiographs obtained today demonstrate pedicle screw placement at L4 and L5 bilaterally without evidence of malposition or change in orientation of the screws. Lumbar spine MRI performed on 07/03/07 is also reviewed. It demonstrates evidence of adequate decompression at L4 and L5. There is a moderate size subcutaneous fluid collection seen, which does not appear compressive and may be compatible with normal postoperative fluid collection, especially given the fact that she had a revision surgery performed. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. ABC is doing relatively well status post L4 and L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation on 07/08/07. The case is significant for merely misdirected right L4 pedicle screw, which was reoriented with subsequent resolution of symptoms. I am uncertain with regard to the etiology of the symptoms. However, it does appear that the radiographs demonstrate appropriate positioning of the instrumentation, no hardware shift, and the MRI demonstrates only a postoperative suprafascial fluid collection. I do not see any indication for another surgery at this time. I would also like to hold off on an interventional pain management given the presence of the fluid collection to decrease the risk of infection. My recommendation at this time is that the patient is to continue with mobilization. I have reassured her that her spine appears stable at this time. She is happy with this. I would like her to continue ambulating as much as possible. She can go ahead and continue with ReQuip for the restless leg syndrome as her primary care physician has suggested. I have also her referred to Mrs. Khan at Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation for continued aggressive management. I will see her back in followup in 3 to 4 weeks to make sure that she continues to improve. She knows that if she has any difficulties, she may follow up with me sooner."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical degenerative disc disease, spondylosis, severe myelopathy, spinal cord compression especially at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6, and progressive quadriparesis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical degenerative disc disease, spondylosis, severe myelopathy, spinal cord compression especially at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6, progressive quadriparesis, and very poor bone quality as well as difficulty with hemostasis with the patient having been on aspirin. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE 1. Anterior cervical discectomy, osteophytectomy, foraminotomies, spinal cord decompression at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6. 2. Microscope. 3. Fusion with machined allografts at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6. 4. Eagle titanium plate from C3 to C6. 5. Jackson-Pratt drain placement. 6. Intraoperative monitoring with EMGs and SSEPs. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 350 cc. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. COMPLICATIONS: None. COUNTS: Correct. SPECIMENS SENT: None. CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is a 77-year-old male who was admitted through the emergency room for progressive weakness and falling. He was worked by the neurologist, Dr. X, and found to have cervical spondylosis with myelopathy. I was consulted and elected to do a lumbar and cervical myelogram CT scan, which showed lumbar stenosis but also cervical stenosis with more pathology anteriorly than posteriorly. The patient had worst disease at level C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6. The patient was significantly weak and almost quadriparetic, stronger on the right side than on the left side. I thought that surgery was indicated to prevent progressive neurological deterioration, as well as to prevent a central cord syndrome if the patient were to get into a motor vehicle accident or simply fall. Conservative management was not an option. The patient was preoped and consented, and was medically cleared. I discussed the indications, risks, and benefits of the surgery with the patient and the patient's family. The risks of bleeding, hoarseness, swallowing difficulty, pseudoarthrosis as well as plate migration and hardware failure were all discussed with the patient. An informed consent was obtained from the patient as such. He was brought into the OR today for the operative procedure. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought into the OR, intubated, and given a general anesthetic. Intubation was done under C-spine precautions. The patient received preoperative vancomycin and Decadron. He was hooked up to the SSEP apparatus and had poor baselines and delays. With a large a shoulder roll, I extended the patient's neck, and landmark incision in crease in the right upper neck, and the area was then prepped and sterilely draped. All the lines had been put in and the arms were padded. Using a knife and cautery, I took the incision down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and arrived at the cervical spine. Prominent osteophyte at C5-C6 was noted, lesser at C4-C5. Intraoperative x-ray confirmed our levels, and we were fully exposed from C3-C6. Trimline retractors were put in, and I cut the discs out as well as removed the superficial hyperstatic bone and osteophytes. With the drill, I performed a superficial discectomy and endplate resection, curetting the endplate as I went. I then brought in the microscope, under the microscopic guidance, firmly removed the end plates and drilled through the posterior longitudinal ligament to decompress the spinal cord. Worst findings at C3-C4 followed C5-C6 and then C4-C5. Excellent thecal sac decompression was achieved and foraminal decompression was also achieved. With change in intraoperative monitoring, a microscope was used for this decompressive procedure. The patient was very oozy throughout this procedure, and during the decompression part, the oozing was constant. This was partly due to the patient's cancellous bone, but he had been on aspirin which was stopped only 2 days ago, and the option was not available to wait 2 to 3 weeks which would have made this man worse simply over time. I thus elected to give him DDAVP, platelets, and used Horsley bone wax for excellent hemostasis. This took literally half-an-hour to an hour and added to the complexity and difficulty of this case. Eventually, with blood pressure controlled and all the other parameters under control, bleeding was somewhat slow. I then selected two 10 and one 9-mm cadaveric allograft, which had soaking in bacitracin solution. These were trimmed to the desired dimensions, and under slight distraction, these were tapped into position. Excellent graft alignment was achieved. I now brought in a DePuy titanium eagle plate, and I fixed it to the spine from C3 to C6. Fourteen millimeter screws were used; all the screws were tightened and torqued. The patient's bone quality was poor, but the screws did torque appropriately. I inspected the plate, controlled the hemostasis, assessed post-fixation x-ray, and was really happy with the screw length and the overall alignment. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution; a Jackson-Pratt drain 10-French was put in with trocar. Decision was made to start the closure. So, I closed the platysma with 3-0 Vicryl and used staples for the skin. A simple Primapore or Medpore dressing was applied. The patient was extubated in the OR and taken to the PSU in stable medical condition. When I saw the patient in the ICU, he was awake, alert, and moving all four extremities, somewhat weak on the left side. He had done well from the surgery. Blood loss was 350 cc. All instrument, needle, and sponge counts were correct. No complications, no change in intraoperative monitoring. No specimens were sent. The patient's wife was spoken to and fully appraised of the intraoperative findings and the expected prognosis. The patient will be kept n.p.o. tonight and will gradually advance his diet, and also will gradually advance his activity. I will keep him on Decadron and keep the collar on. I do not think there is need for halo rest. We will be obtaining formal C-spine films in the morning. Prognosis is guarded but favorable at this time."
Orthopedic," PROCEDURES PERFORMED: C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy, allograft fusion, and anterior plating. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 10 mL. CLINICAL NOTE: This is a 57-year-old gentleman with refractory neck pain with single-level degeneration of the cervical spine and there was also some arm pain. We decided go ahead with anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 and fusion. The risks of lack of pain relief, paralysis, hoarse voice, nerve injuries, and infection were explained and the patient agreed to proceed. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room where a general endotracheal anesthesia was induced without complication. The patient was placed in the slightly extended position with the neck and the head was restrained in a doughnut and the occiput was restrained by the doughnut. He had tape placed over the shoulders during intraoperative x-rays and his elbows were well padded. The tape was placed and his arms were well padded. He was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. A linear incision was fashioned at the cricothyroid level from near the midline to over the sternocleidomastoid muscle. We separated the platysma from the subcutaneous tissue and then opened the platysma along the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. We then dissected sharply medial to carotid artery, which we palpated to the prevertebral region. We placed Caspar retractors for medial and lateral exposure over the C5-C6 disc space, which we confirmed with the lateral cervical spine x-ray including 18-gauge needle in the disc space. We then marked the disc space. We then drilled off ventral osteophyte as well as osteophyte creating concavity within the disc space. We then under magnification removed all the disc material, we could possibly see down to bleeding bone and both the endplates. We took down posterior longitudinal ligament as well. We incised the 6-mm cornerstone bone. We placed a 6-mm parallel medium bone nicely into the disc space. We then sized a 23-mm plate. We inserted the screws nicely above and below. We tightened down the lock-nuts. We irrigated the wound. We assured hemostasis using bone wax prior to placing the plate. We then assured hemostasis once again. We reapproximated the platysma using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion. The subcutaneous level was closed using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple buried fashion. The skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular stitch. Steri-Strips were applied. Dry sterile dressing with Telfa was applied over this. We obtained an intraoperative x-ray to confirm the proper level and good position of both plates and screw construct on the lateral x-ray and the patient was transferred to the recovery room, moving all four extremities with stable vital signs. I was present as a primary surgeon throughout the entire case."
Orthopedic," TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial CT images were obtained through the cervical spine without contrast. Additional high resolution coronal and sagittal reconstructed images were also obtained for better visualization of the osseous structures. FINDINGS: The cervical spine demonstrates normal alignment and mineralization with no evidence of fracture, dislocation, or spondylolisthesis. The vertebral body heights and disc spaces are maintained. The central canal is patent. The pedicles and posterior elements are intact. The paravertebral soft tissues are within normal limits. The atlanto-dens interval and the dens are intact. The visualized lung apices are clear. IMPRESSION: No acute abnormalities."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus of L5-S1 on the left. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus of L5-S1 on the left. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Microscopic assisted lumbar laminotomy with discectomy at L5-S1 on the left. ANESTHESIA: General via endotracheal tube. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 50 cc. SPECIMENS: Disc that was not sent to the lab. DRAINS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. SURGICAL PROGNOSIS: Remains guarded due to her ongoing pain condition and Tarlov cyst at the L5 nerve root distally. SURGICAL INDICATIONS: The patient is a 51-year-old female who has had unrelenting low back pain that radiated down her left leg for the past several months. The symptoms were unrelieved by conservative modalities. The symptoms were interfering with all aspects of daily living and inability to perform any significant work endeavors. She is understanding the risks, benefits, potential complications, as well as all treatment alternatives. She wished to proceed with the aforementioned surgery due to her persistent symptoms. Informed consent was obtained. OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: The patient was taken to OR room #5 where she was given general anesthetic by the Department of Anesthesia. She was subsequently placed on the Jackson spinal table with the Wilson attachment in the prone position. Palpation did reveal the iliac crest and suspected L5-S1 interspace. Thereafter the lumbar spine was serially prepped and draped. A midline incision was carried over the spinal process of L5 to S1. Skin and subcutaneous tissue were divided sharply. Electrocautery provided hemostasis. Electrocautery was then utilized to dissect through the subcutaneous tissues to the lumbar fascia. Lumbar fascia was identified and the decussation of fibers was identified at the L5-S1 interspace. On the left side, superior aspect dissection was carried out with the Cobb elevator and electrocautery. This revealed the interspace of suspect level of L5-S1 on the left. A Kocher clamp was placed between the spinous processes of the suspect level of L5-S1. X-ray did confirm the L5-S1 interval. Angled curet was utilized to detach the ligamentum flavum from its bony attachments at the superior edge of S1 lamina and the inferior edge of the L5 lamina. Meticulous dissection was undertaken and the ligamentum flavum was removed. Laminotomy was created with Kerrison rongeur, both proximally and distally. The microscope was positioned and the dura was inspected. A blunt Penfield elevator was then utilized to dissect and identify the L5-S1 nerve root on the left. It was noted to be tented over a disc extrusion. The nerve root was protected and medialized. It was retracted with a nerve root retractor. This did reveal a subligamentous disc herniation at approximately the L5-S1 disc space and neuroforaminal area. A #15 Bard-Parker blade was utilized to create an annulotomy. Medially, disc material was extruding through this annulotomy. Two tier rongeur was then utilized to grasp the disc material and the disc was removed from the interspace. Additional disc material was then removed, both to the right and left of the annulotomy. Up and downbiting pituitary rongeurs were utilized to remove any other loose disc pieces. Once this was completed, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry. The Penfield elevator was placed in the disc space of L5-S1 and a crosstable x-ray did confirm this level. Nerve root was again expected exhibiting the foramina. A foraminotomy was created with a Kerrison rongeur. Once this was created, the nerve root was again inspected and deemed free of tension. It was mobile within the neural foramina. The wound was again copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry. A free fat graft was then harvested from the subcutaneous tissues and placed over the exposed dura. Lumbar fascia was then approximated with #1 Vicryl interrupted fashion, subcutaneous tissue with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted fashion, and #4-0 undyed Vicryl was utilized to approximate the skin. Compression dressing was applied. The patient was turned, awoken, and noted to be moving all four extremities without apparent deficits. She was taken to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition. Expected surgical prognosis remains guarded due to her ongoing pain syndrome that has been requiring significant narcotic medications."

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General: Reveals a pleasant somewhat emaciated Caucasian female. Vital Signs: Height is 5 feet 2 inches. Weight is 130 pounds. She is afebrile. HEENT: Benign. Neck: Shows functional range of movements with a negative Spurling's. Chest: Clear to auscultation. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen: Soft, regular bowel sounds. Musculoskeletal: Examination shows functional range of joint movements. No focal muscle weakness. She is deconditioned. Neurologic: She is alert and oriented with appropriate mood and affect. The patient has normal tone and coordination. Reflexes are 2+ in both knees and absent at both ankles. Sensations are decreased distally in the left foot, otherwise intact to pinprick. Spine: Examination of her lumbar spine shows normal lumbar lordosis with fairly functional range of movement. The patient had significant tenderness at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints, which seems to reproduce a lot of her low back and right leg complaints. FUNCTIONAL EXAMINATION: Gait has a normal stance and swing phase with no antalgic component to it. INVESTIGATION: She has had again multiple scans including a whole body bone scan, which showed abnormal uptake involving the femurs bilaterally. She has had increased uptake in the sacroiliac joint regions bilaterally. CT of the chest showed no evidence of recurrent metastatic disease. CT of the abdomen showed no evidence of metastatic disease. MRI of the lower hip joints showed heterogenous bone marrow signal in both proximal femurs. CT of the pelvis showed a trabecular pattern with healed metastases. CT of the orbits showed small amount of fluid in the mastoid air cells on the right, otherwise normal CT scan. MR of the brain showed no acute intracranial abnormalities and no significant interval changes. IMPRESSION: 1. Small cell lung cancer with metastasis at the lower lumbar spine, pelvis, and both femurs. 2. Symptomatic facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome on the right. 3. Chronic pain syndrome. RECOMMENDATIONS: Dr. XYZ and I discussed with the patient her pathology. Dr. XYZ explained her although she does have lung cancer metastasis, she seems to be symptomatic with primarily pain at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints on the right. Secondary to the patient's significant pain complaints today, Dr. XYZ will plan on injecting her right sacroiliac and facet joints under fluoroscopy today. I explained the rationale for the procedure, possible complications, and she voiced understanding and wished to proceed. She understands that she is on warfarin therapy and that we generally do not perform injections while they are on this. We have asked for stat protime today. She is on a very small dose, she states she has had previous biopsies while on this before, and did not have any complications. She is on significant dose of narcotics already, however, she continues to have pain symptoms. Dr. XYZ advised that if she continues to have pain, even after this injection, she could put on an extra 50 mcg patch and take a couple of extra Percocet if needed. I will plan on evaluating her in the Clinic on Tuesday. I have also asked that she stop her Paxil, and we plan on starting her on Cymbalta instead. She voiced understanding and is in agreement with this plan. I have also asked her to get an x-ray of the lumbar spine for further evaluation. Physical exam, findings, history of present illness, and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. G's findings. Peripheral neuropathy of her left foot is most likely secondary to her chemo and radiation treatments."
Orthopedic," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left shoulder injury. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 41-year-old male presenting for initial evaluation of his left shoulder. He works at ABC and two days ago was walking though an area, where there was some oil spilled on the floor. He fell and landed on bilateral outstretched arms and then further fell landing primarily on his left shoulder. He presents today reporting primarily posterior shoulder pain. The right shoulder was bothersome yesterday, but is now asymptomatic. He has no anterior shoulder pain. He denies any feelings of weakness. He reports some improvement over the last two days especially in his range of motion. He was able to get into the swimming pool last night with his children without difficulty. He has had no additional treatment other than over-the-counter Advil. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has no significant past medical history with the exception of previous hand fracture and tibia fracture. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Vasectomy. ALLERGIES: No know medicine allergies. MEDICATIONS: No current medications. SOCIAL HISTORY: Works at ABC. Social alcohol and he does smoke. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No fever. No chills. No shortness of breath or numbness or tingling. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: In general, the patient is an alert and cooperative male in no acute distress. He has full active and passive range of motion of the left shoulder, which is symmetric to the right. Forward elevation approximately 165 degrees with symmetric internal and external rotation. He has some posterior shoulder discomfort with resisted external rotation. He has no tenderness over the biceps tendon. No tenderness over the AC joint. No tenderness over the anterior or lateral acromion. His primary area of tenderness is over the infraspinatus and supraspinatus fossa of the scapula posteriorly. He has 4+/5 strength to the supraspinatus, which is somewhat limited by pain. He has 2+ pulses and sensation is intact over the deltoid as well as distally in the hand. X-RAYS: Two views of the left shoulder were taken in clinic and reviewed revealing no fractures and no glenohumeral degenerative disease. He does have some AC degeneration. ASSESSMENT: Left shoulder contusion. PLAN: At this time, the patient feels he is improving significantly since his injury. He was given a prescription for Mobic. We offered physical therapy; however, he feels he is improving rapidly and would like to do range of motion exercises on his own at home. These were demonstrated for him today. I also advised him to limit overhead use of his shoulder as much as possible at work; however, he feels he can return to full duty, so this was written for him. He will return in four weeks. If he feels 100% better at that time, he will call and cancel."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right failed total knee arthroplasty. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right failed total knee arthroplasty. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Revision right total knee arthroplasty. FIRST ANESTHESIA: Spinal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Approximately 75 cc. TOURNIQUET TIME: 123 minutes. Then it was let down for approximately 15 minutes and then reinflated for another 26 minutes for a total of 149 minutes. COMPONENTS: A Zimmer NexGen Legacy knee size D right stemmed femoral component was used. A NexGen femoral component with a distal femoral augmented block, size 5 mm. A NexGen tibial component, size 3 mm was used. A size 14 mm constrained polyethylene surface was used as well. Original patellar component that the patient had was maintained. COMPLICATIONS: None. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of knee pain for 13 years. She had previous total knee arthroplasty and revision at an outside facility. She had continued pain, snapping, malalignment, difficulty with ambulation, and giving away and wished to undergo additional revision surgery. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed on the operating table. Department of Anesthesia administered the spinal anesthetic. Once adequately anesthetized, the patient was placed in a supine position. Care was ensured and she was adequately secured and well padded in position. Once this was obtained, the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Tourniquet was inflated to approximately 325 mmHg on the right thigh. At this point, an incision was made over her anterior previous knee scar taking this down to the subcutaneous tissue of the overlying retinaculum. A medial parapatellar arthrotomy was then made by using a second knife and this was taken both distally and proximally to allow us to sublux the patella on the lateral aspect to allow exposure to the joint surface. There was noted to be no evidence of purulence or gross clinical appearance of infection, however, intraoperative cultures were taken to asses this as well. At this point, the previous articular surface was then removed using an osteotome until this was left free and then removed. This was done without difficulty. Attention was then directed removing the femoral component. Osteotome was taken around each of the edges until this was gently lifted up and then a femoral extractor was placed around it and this was back flapped until this was easily removed. After this was performed, attention was then directed to the tibial component. An osteotome was again inserted around the surface and this was easily pried loose. There was noted to be minimal difficulty with this and did not appear to have adequate cement fixation. This was evaluated. The bone stalk appeared to be adequate, however, there were noted to be some deficits where we need to trim cement, so we elected to proceed with stemmed component. The attention was first directed to the femur and the femoral canal was opened up and superficially reamed up to a size 18 mm proximal portion for the Zimmer stemmed component. At this point, the distal femoral cut was evaluated with a intramedullary guide and this was noted to be cut in a varus cut leaving us a large deficit of the medial femoral cut. We elected because of this large amount of retic to take off the medial condyle to correct this varus cut to a six degree valgus cut. We elected to augment the medial aspect and take only 5 mm off of the lateral condyle instead of a full 10 to 12. At this point, the distal femoral cutting guide based on the intramedullary head was then placed. Care was ensured that this was aligned in proper rotation with the external epicondylar axis. Once this was pinned in position, approximately a six degree valgus cut was then made. This allowed a portion of the medial condyle to be removed distally. The anterior cut was checked next using the intramedullary guide. The anterior surface cutting block was then placed. This aligned us to anterior cutting block. We ensured again that rotation was aligned with the epicondylar axis. Once this was adequately aligned with this and gave us some external rotation, this was pinned in position and new anterior cut was made. It was noted that minimal bone was taken off the surface, only a slight portion on the medial anterior surface. _______ was then removed and the chamfer cutting guide was then placed on. This allowed us to make a box cut and recut some of the angled cuts of the distal femur. Once this was placed and pinned in position. Care was then again taken to check that this was in proper rotation and then the chamfer cuts were recut. It was noted that the anterior chamfers did not need to be cut, take off no bone. The posterior chamfers did remove some bony aspects. This was also taken off some of the posterior aspects of the condyles and then the ossicle saw and reciprocal saw were used to take off a notch cut to open up a constrained component. After all these cuts were taken, the guides were then removed and the trial component with a medial 5 mm augment was then placed. This appeared to have an adequate fit and then packed in position. It appeared to be satisfactory. At this point, this was removed and attention was then directed to the tibia. The intramedullary canal was again opened up using a proximal drill and this was reamed to the appropriate size until good _______ was obtained. At this point, the intramedullary guide was used to evaluate a tibial cut. This appeared to be adequate, however, we elected to remove 2 mm of bone to give us a new fresh bony surface. The cutting guide was placed in adequate alignment and checked both the with intramedullary guide and an external alignment rod, which allowed us to ensure that we had proper external rotation of this tibial component. At this point, this was pinned in position and the tibial cut was made to remove an extra 2 mm of bone. This was again removed and a trial tibial stemmed component was then placed as well as the trial augmented stemmed femoral component. This was placed in a proper position. A 10 mm articular surface was placed in the knee and this was taken through range of motion. This was found to have better alignment and satisfactory position. We elected to take an intraoperative x-ray at this point, to evaluate our cut. The intraoperative x-ray demonstrates satisfactory cuts and alignment of the prosthesis. At this point, all trials were removed. The patella was then examined. The rongeur was used to remove the surrounding synovium. The patella was evaluated and found to have mild wear on the lateral aspect of the inferior butt, however, this was very mild and overall had a good position and was well fixed to the bone. It was elected at this time to maintain this anatomic patella that was previously placed. At this point, the joint again was reevaluated and any bone loose fragments removed. There was noted to be some posterior tightness and mild osteophytes. These were removed with a rongeur. At this time, while preparing the canals, the tourniquet was deflated due to it being 123 minutes. Approximately 10 minutes did get by, as the knee was copiously irrigated and suctioned dried. The tourniquet was then reinflated. The canals were prepped for cementing. They were suction-dried and cleaned. The tibial component was cemented and then impacted into position and ensured it was adequately aligned in proper external rotation and alignment that was previously tried with the trial. Once this was fixed and secured, all extra cement was removed and attention was directed to the femoral component. The stemmed femoral component was then impacted in position and cemented. Again care was ensured that it was in adequate position and proper rotation. A size 14 mm poly was then inserted in between to provide compression. This was then taken through extension and held until cement cured. This was then removed and the components were evaluated. All excess cement was removed and they were well fixed. Size 14 mm trial Poly was then placed and this was taken through range of motion. This was found to have excellent range of motion and good stability. It was elected at this time that we would go with the size 14 mm Poly. This gave us extra Poly for ware and then provide excellent contact throughout the range of motion. The final articular surface was then placed and tightened into position to allow to _______ secured. The knee was then reduced and the knee was taken through range of motion. The patella was tracking with no-touch technique and adequately positioned. At this point, the tourniquet was deflated for second time and then the knee was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. All bleeding was cauterized using a Bovie cautery. The retinaculum was then repaired using #1 Ethibond in a figure-of-eight fashion. This was reinforced with a running #2-0 Vicryl. The knee was then flexed and noted that the patella was tracking with good alignment. The wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. A drain was placed prior to retinaculum repair deep to this to provide adequate drainage. At this point, the subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2-0 Vicryl. Skin was approximated with skin clips. Sterile dressing of Adaptic, 4x4, Webril, and ABDs were then placed. A large Dupre dressing was then placed up the entire lower extremity. The patient was then transferred back to recovery in supine position. DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications and transferred to PACU in satisfactory condition."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Recurrent herniation L4-5 disk with left radiculopathy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Recurrent herniation L4-5 disk with left radiculopathy. PROCEDURE: Redo L4-5 diskectomy left. COMPLICATIONS: None. ANTIBIOTIC (S): Vancomycin given preoperatively. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 10 mL. BLOOD REPLACED: None. CRYSTALLOID GIVEN: 800 mL. DRAIN (S): None. DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the operating room in supine position. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered. He was turned into the prone position on the operating table and positioned in the modified knee-chest position with Andrews frame being used. Care was taken to protect pressure points. The back was shaved, scrubbed with Betadine scrub, rinsed with alcohol, and prepped with DuraPrep, and draped in the usual sterile fashion with Ioban drape being used. A midline skin incision was made, excising scar from previous surgery. Dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery technique. The lumbosacral fascia was split to the left of the spinous process, and subperiosteal dissection of the spinous process and lamina, area of previous laminotomy was identified. Cross-table lateral was also made to confirm position. The scar was then loosened from the inferior portion of 4, superior of L5 lamina, and a portion of the lamina was removed. I did identify normal dura. The scar was then lysed from the medial wall. Dura and nerve root were identified and protected with nerve root retractor. The bulging disk fragment was still contained under the longitudinal ligament. A rent was made with the Penfield and a moderately large fragment was removed. The disk space was then entered with a cruciate cut in the annulus, with additional nuclear material being received. When no other fragments could be removed from the disk space, no other fragments were felt in the central canal under the longitudinal ligament, and a Murphy ball could be passed through the foramen without evidence of compression, the decompression was complete. Check was made for CSF leakage, and no evidence of significant epidural bleeding was present. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution. Twenty milligrams of Depo-Medrol was placed over the dura and nerve root. A free fat graft from the subcutaneous tissue was then placed over the dura. Closure was obtained with the lumbosacral fascia being reapproximated with #1, running, Vicryl suture. Subcutaneous closure was obtained in layers with 2-0, running, Vicryl suture. Skin closure was obtained with 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular suture. Proxi-Strips and sterile dressing was applied. The skin had been infiltrated with 8 mL of 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine. After a sterile dressing was applied, the patient was turned into the supine position on the waiting recovery room stretcher, brought from under the effects of anesthesia, and taken to the recovery room."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Infected right hip bipolar arthroplasty, status post excision and placement of antibiotic spacer. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Infected right hip bipolar arthroplasty, status post excision and placement of antibiotic spacer. PROCEDURES: 1. Removal of antibiotic spacer. 2. Revision total hip arthroplasty. IMPLANTS 1. Hold the Zimmer trabecular metal 50 mm acetabular shell with two 6.5 x 30 mm screws. 2. Zimmer femoral component, 13.5 x 220 mm with a size AA femoral body. 3. A 32-mm femoral head with a +0 neck length. ANESTHESIA: Regional. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 500 cc. COMPLICATIONS: None. DRAINS: Hemovac times one and incisional VAC times one. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of previous right bipolar hemiarthroplasty for trauma. This subsequently became infected. She has undergone removal of this prosthesis and placement of antibiotic spacer. She currently presents for stage II reconstruction with removal of antibiotic spacer and placement of a revision total hip. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room by anesthesia personnel. She was placed supine on the operating table. A Foley catheter was inserted. A formal time out was obtained in identifying the correct patient, operative site. Preoperative antibiotics were held for intraoperative cultures. The patient was placed into the lateral decubitus position with the right side up. The previous surgical incision was identified. The right lower extremity was prepped and draped in standard fashion. The old surgical incision was reopened along its proximal extent. Immediately encountered was a large amount of fibrous scar tissue. Dissection was carried sharply down through this scar tissue. Soft tissue plains were extremely difficult to visualize due to all the scarring. There was no native tissue to orient oneself with. We carried our dissection down through the scar tissue to what seemed to be a fascial layer. We incised through the fascial layer down to some scarred gluteus maximus muscle and down over what was initially felt to be the greater trochanter. Dissection was carried down through soft tissue and the distal located antibiotic spacer was exposed. This was used as a landmark to orient remainder of the dissection. The antibiotic spacer was exposed and followed distally to expose the proximal femur. Dissection was continued posteriorly and proximally to expose the acetabulum. A cobra retractor was able to be inserted across the superior aspect of the acetabulum to enhance exposure. Once improved visualization was obtained, the antibiotic spacer was removed from the femur. This allowed further improved visualization of the acetabulum. The acetabulum was filled with soft tissue debris and scar tissue. This was removed with sharp excision with a knife as well as with a rongeur and a Bovie. Once soft tissue was removed, the acetabulum was reamed. Reaming was started with a 46-mm reamer and carried up sequentially to prepare for 50-mm shell. The 50 mm shell was trialed and had good stability and fit. Attention was then turned to continue preparation of the femur. The canal was then debrided with femoral canal curettes. Some fibrous tissue was removed from the canal. The length of the femoral stem was then checked with this canal curette in place. Following x-rays, we prepared to begin reaming the femur. This femur was reamed over a guide rod using flexible reaming rods. The canal was reamed up to 13.5 mm distally in preparation for 14 mm stem. The stem was selected and initially size A body was placed in trial. The body was too tight proximally to fit. The proximal canal was then reamed for a size AA body. A longer stem with an anterior bow was selected and a size AA trial was assembled. This fit nicely in the canal and had good fit and fill. Intraoperative radiographs were obtained to determine component position. Intraoperative radiographs revealed satisfactory length of the component past the distal of fractures in the femur. The remainder of the trial was then assembled and the hip was relocated and trialed. Initially, it was found to be unstable posteriorly. We changed from a 10 degree lip liner to 20 degree lip liner. Again, the hip was trialed and found to be unstable posteriorly. This was due to reversion of the femoral component. As we attempted to seat the prosthesis, the stent continued to attempt to turn in retroversion. The stem was extracted and retrialed. Improved stability was obtained and we decided to proceed with the real components. A 20 degree liner was inserted into the acetabular shell. The real femoral components were assembled and inserted into the femoral canal. Again, the hip was trialed. The components were found to be in relative retroversion. The real components were then backed down and the neck was placed in the more anteversion and reinserted. Again, the stem attempted to follow in the relative retroversion. Along with this time, however, it was improved from previous attempts. The femoral head trial was placed back on the components and the hip relocated. It was taken to a range of motion and found to have improved stability compared to previous trialing. Decision was made to accept the component position. The real femoral head was selected and implanted. The hip was then taken again to a range of motion. It was stable at 90 degrees of flexion with 20 degrees of adduction and 40 degrees of internal rotation. The patient reached full extension and had no instability anteriorly. The wound was then irrigated again with pulsatile lavage. Six liters of pulsatile lavage was used during the procedure. The wound was then closed in a layered fashion. A Hemovac drain was placed deep to the fascial layer. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with #1 PDS, 2-0 PDS, and staples in the skin. An incisional VAC was then placed over the wound as well. Sponge and needle counts were correct at the close of the case. DISPOSITION: The patient will be weightbearing as tolerated with posterior hip precautions."
Orthopedic," TITLE OF OPERATION: 1. Irrigation and debridement of postoperative wound infection (CPT code 10180). 2. Removal of foreign body, deep (CPT code 28192). 3. Placement of vacuum-assisted closure device, less than 50 centimeter squared (CPT code 97605). PREOP DIAGNOSIS: Postoperative wound infection, complicated (ICD-9 code 998.59). POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: Postoperative wound infection, complicated (ICD-9 code 998.59). PROCEDURE DETAIL: The patient is a 59-year-old gentleman who is status post open reduction and internal fixation of bilateral calcanei. He was admitted for a left wound breakdown with drainage. He underwent an irrigation and debridement with VAC placement 72 hours prior to this operative visit. It was decided to bring him back for a repeat irrigation and debridement and VAC change prior to Plastics doing a local flap. The risks of surgery were discussed in detail including, but not limited to infection, bleeding, injuries to nerves and vital structures, need for reoperation, pain or stiffness, arthritis, fracture, the risk of anesthesia. The patient understood these risks and wished to proceed. The patient was admitted, and the operative site was marked. The patient was brought to the operating room and given general anesthetic. He was placed in the right lateral decubitus, and all bony prominences were well padded. An axillary roll was placed. A well-padded thigh tourniquet was placed on the left leg. The patient then received antibiotics on the floor prior to coming down to the operating room which satisfied the preoperative requirement. Left leg was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. The previous five antibiotic spacer beads were removed without difficulty. The wound was then rongeured and curetted, and all bone was cleaned down to healthy bleeding bone. The wound actually looked quite good with evidence of purulence or drainage. Skin edges appeared to be viable. Hardware all looked to be intact. At this point, the wound was irrigated with 9 liters of bibiotic solution. A VAC sponge was then placed over the wound, and the patient's leg was placed into a posterior splint. The patient was awakened and then taken to recovery in good condition. Dr. X was present for the timeouts and for all critical portions of the procedure. He was immediately available for any questions during the case. PLAN: 1. A CAM walker boots. 2. A VAC change on Sunday by the nurse. 3. A flap per Plastic Surgery."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Sacro-iliitis (720.2), lumbo-sacral segmental dysfunction (739.3), thoraco-lumbar segmental dysfunction (739.2), associated with myalgia/fibromyositis (729.1). POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Sacro-iliitis (720.2), lumbo-sacral segmental dysfunction (739.3), thoraco-lumbar segmental dysfunction (739.2), associated with myalgia/fibromyositis (729.1). ANESTHESIA: Conscious Sedation. INFORMED CONSENT: After adequate explanation of the medical surgical and procedural options, this patient has decided to proceed with the recommended spinal Manipulation under Anesthesia (MUA). The patient has been informed that more than one procedure may be necessary to achieve the satisfactory results. INDICATION: This patient has failed extended conservative care of condition/dysfunction by means of aggressive physical medical and pharmacological intervention. COMMENTS: This patient understands the essence of the diagnosis and the reasons for the MUA- The associated risks of the procedure, including anesthesia complications, fracture, vascular accidents, disc herniation and post-procedure discomfort, were thoroughly discussed with the patient. Alternatives to the procedure, including the course of the condition without MUA, were discussed. The patient understands the chances of success from undergoing MUA and that no guarantees are made or implied regarding outcome. The patient has given both verbal and written informed consent for the listed procedure. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was draped in the appropriate gowning and accompanied to the operative area. Following their sacral block injection, they were asked to lie supine on the operative table and they were placed on the appropriate monitors for this procedure. When the patient and I were ready, the anesthesiologist administered the appropriate medications to assist the patient into the twilight sedation using medication which allows the stretching, mobilization, and adjustments necessary for the completion of the outcome I desired. THORACIC SPINE: With the patient in the supine position on the operative table, the upper extremities were flexed at the elbow and crossed over the patient's chest to achieve maximum traction to the patient's thoracic spine. The first assistant held the patient's arms in the proper position and assisted in rolling the patient for the adjusting procedure. With the help of the first assist, the patient was rolled to their right side, selection was made for the contact point and the patient was rolled back over the doctor's hand. The elastic barrier of resistance was found, and a low velocity thrust was achieved using a specific closed reduction anterior to posterior/superior manipulative procedure. The procedure was completed at the level of TI-TI2. Cavitation was achieved. LUMBAR SPINE/SACRO-ILIAC JOINTS: With the patient supine on the procedure table, the primary physician addressed the patient's lower extremities which were elevated alternatively in a straight leg raising manner to approximately 90 degrees from the horizontal. Linear force was used to increase the hip flexion gradually during this maneuver. Simultaneously, the first assist physician applied a myofascial release technique to the calf and posterior thigh musculature. Each lower extremity was independently bent at the knee and tractioned cephalad in a neutral sagittal plane, lateral oblique cephalad traction, and medial oblique cephalad traction maneuver. The primary physician then approximated the opposite single knee from his position from neutral to medial slightly beyond the elastic barrier of resistance. (a piriformis myofascial release was accomplished at this time). This was repeated with the opposite lower extremity. Following this, a Patrick-Fabere maneuver was performed up to and slightly beyond the elastic barrier of resistance. With the assisting physician stabling the pelvis and femoral head (as necessary), the primary physician extended the right lower extremity in the sagittal plane, and while applying controlled traction gradually stretched the para-articular holding elements of the right hip by means gradually describing an approximately 30-35 degree horizontal arc. The lower extremity was then tractioned, and straight caudal and internal rotation was accomplished. Using traction, the lower extremity was gradually stretched into a horizontal arch to approximately 30 degrees. This procedure was then repeated using external rotation to stretch the para-articular holding elements of the hips bilaterally. These procedures were then repeated on the opposite lower extremity. By approximating the patient's knees to the abdomen in a knee-chest fashion (ankles crossed), the lumbo-pelvic musculature was stretched in the sagittal plane, by both the primary and first assist, contacting the base of the sacrum and raising the lower torso cephalad, resulting in passive flexion of the entire lumbar spine and its holding elements beyond the elastic barrier of resistance With the patient's lower extremities kept in hip/knee flexion,, the patient's torso was secured by the first assistant and the lumbar fascia/musculature elongated obliquely to the right and midline, in a controlled manner up to and beyond the elastic barrier of resistance. Cavitation was noted. This was repeated on the opposite side by the first assist. With the use of the undersheets, the patient was carefully placed in the decubitus position (right side down) and positioned so that the lumbar spine overlay the kidney plate to the point where the lumbar spine attained the horizontal and was derotated to avoid facet imbrication. The patient's body was stabilized in the extended position by the first assist. Segmental localization of the appropriate lumbar motion units was made by the primary physician and the elastic barrier of resistance found. A low velocity impulse thrust was applied achieving cavitation. .The sacro-iliac joint was then adjusted in the same position as above. The procedure was repeated on the opposite side by the first assist. The patient was then repositioned supine by means of the undersheet. With appropriate assistance, the patient was transferred from the procedure table to the gurney and was returned to the recovery room, where appropriate monitoring equipment was utilized to monitor vital signs. The IV was maintained to the point where the patient was fully alert and stable, and the patient was then transferred to a sitting recovery position and was given fluids and a light snack. Following this, the patient was discharged with appropriate home and rehabilitation instructions. COMPLICATIONS: The patient tolerated the procedure well with no untoward incident or complication. SUMMARY: The patient tolerated the procedure well and without complications and recovered from the anesthesia without difficulty. The patient is to return per standing orders."
Orthopedic," EXAM:MRI LEFT SHOULDER CLINICAL:This is a 26 year old with a history of instability. Examination was preformed on 12/20/2005. FINDINGS: There is supraspinatus tendinosis without a full-thickness tear, gap or fiber retraction and there is no muscular atrophy (series #105 images #4-6). Normal infraspinatus and subscapularis tendons. Normal long biceps tendon within the bicipital groove.

There are multiple intraarticular bodies, and there is a partial tear of the inferior and middle glenohumeral ligaments. There is medial subluxation of the long biceps tendon under the transverse humeral ligament with partial tearing of the intracapsular portion."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Partial rotator cuff tear with impingement syndrome. 2. Degenerative osteoarthritis of acromioclavicular joint, left shoulder, rule out slap lesion. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Partial rotator cuff tear with impingement syndrome. 2. Degenerative osteoarthritis of acromioclavicular joint, left shoulder. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Arthroscopy with arthroscopic rotator cuff debridement. 2. Anterior acromioplasty. 3. Mumford procedure left shoulder. SPECIFICATIONS: The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operative Suite, Room #1 at ABCD General Hospital. This was done in a modified beach chair position with interscalene and subsequent general anesthetic. HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: This is a 38-year-old morbidly obese white male suffering increasing pain in his left shoulder for a number of months prior to surgical intervention. He was refractory to conservative outpatient therapy. He had injection of his AC joint, which removed symptoms but was not long lasting. After discussing the alternatives of the care as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above-stated procedure on this date. Intraarticular viewing of the joint revealed a partial rotator cuff tear on the supraspinatus insertion on the joint side. All else was noted to be intact including the glenohumeral joint, the long head of the biceps, and the labrum. The remainder of the rotator cuff observed was noted to be intact. Subacromially, the patient was noted to have increased synovitis. Degenerative changes were noted upon observation of the distal clavicle. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was laid supine upon the operative table. After receiving interscalene block anesthetic by Anesthesia Department, the patient was placed in modified beach chair position. He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Portals were created posteriorly and anteriorly from outside to in. A full and complete diagnostic intraarticular arthroscopy was carried out. Debridement was carried out through a 3.5 meniscal shaver to the 4.2 meniscal shaver to the undersurface of the partial tear of the rotator cuff. Retrospectively it was approximately 25% of the generalized thickness. Attention was then turned to the subacromial region. The scope was directed subacromially. A portal was created laterally. Ultimately, the patient needed a general anesthetic once we were closer to the distal clavicle. Gross bursectomy was carried out with a 4.2 meniscal shaver. #18-gauge spinal needles have been placed to outline the anterior acromion prior to this. It was difficult to control the patient's blood pressure with systolics ranging anywhere from 165 or 170 up to 200. Because of this and difficulties with his anesthetic, it was elected to change to an open procedure. Thus, the patient was anesthetized safely and secured. An oblique incision was carried at the cross Langer's line across the outlet of the shoulder through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Hemostasis was controlled via electrocoagulation. Flaps were created. Anterior deltoid was reflected inferiorly. Anterior acromioplasty was carried out with a saw then a Micro-Aire and then a beaver-tail rasp. An excellent decompression was present. CA ligament had been previously resected. We then took the incision over the distal clavicle. The end of the distal clavicle approximately 12 mm to 14 mm was isolated and removed with the Micro-Aire saw. The beaver-tail rasp was utilized to smooth off the edges. Pain buster catheter was placed deep to closure of the AC capsule and then to the deltoid with interrupted #1 Vicryl. Transosseous sutures were placed across the acromion and the deltoid was elevated and closed with the same. A superficial running #2-0 Vicryl suture was utilized for deltoid closure distally. Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized to subcutaneous fat closure, running #4-0 subcuticular stitch for skin closure and Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for compression dressing. 0.25% Marcaine was flooded into the joint prior to the skin closure. Pain buster catheter was hooked up. The patient's arm was placed in arm sling. He was safely transferred to the PACU in apparent satisfactory condition. Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right hip osteoarthritis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right hip osteoarthritis. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Total hip replacement on the right side using the following components: 1. Zimmer trilogy acetabular system 10-degree elevated rim located at the 12 o'clock position. 2. Trabecular metal modular acetabular system 48 mm in diameter. 3. Femoral head 32 mm diameter +0 mm neck length. 4. Alloclassic SL offset stem uncemented for taper. ANESTHESIA: Spinal. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought into the operating room and was placed on the operative table in a lateral decubitus position with the right side up. After review of allergies, antibiotics were administered and time out was performed. The right lower extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. A 15 cm to 25 cm in length, an incision was made over the greater trochanter. This was angled posteriorly. Access to the tensor fascia lata was performed. This was incised with the use of scissors. Gluteus maximus was separated. The bursa around the hip was identified, and the bleeders were coagulated with the use of Bovie. Hemostasis was achieved. The piriformis fossa was identified, and the piriformis fossa tendon was elevated with the use of a Cobb. It was detached from the piriformis fossa and tagged with 2-0 Vicryl. Access to the capsule was performed. The capsule was excised from the posterior and superior aspects. It was released also in the front with the use of a Mayo scissors. The hip was then dislocated. With the use of an oscillating saw, the femoral neck cut was performed. The acetabulum was then visualized and debrided from soft tissues and osteophytes. Reaming was initiated and completed for a 48 mm diameter cap without complications. The trial component was put in place and was found to be stable in an anatomic position. The actual component was then impacted in the acetabulum. A 10-degree lip polyethylene was also placed in the acetabular cap. Our attention was then focused to the femur. With the use of a cookie cutter, the femoral canal was accessed. The broaching process was initiated for No.4 trial component. Trialing of the hip with the hip flexed at 90 degrees and internally rotated to 30 degrees did not demonstrate any obvious instability or dislocation. In addition, in full extension and external rotation, there was no dislocation. The actual component was inserted in place and hemostasis was achieved again. The wound was irrigated with normal saline. The wound was then closed in layers. Before performing that the medium-sized Hemovac drain was placed in the wound. The tensor fascia lata was closed with 0 PDS and the wound was closed with 2-0 Monocryl. Staples were used for the skin. The patient recovered from anesthesia without complications. EBL: 50 mL. IV FLUIDS: 2 liters. DRAINS: One medium-sized Hemovac. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: The patient was transferred to the PACU in stable condition. She will be weightbearing as tolerated to the right lower extremity with posterior hip precautions. We will start the DVT prophylaxis after the removal of the epidural catheter."

Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: T12 compression fracture with cauda equina syndrome and spinal cord compression. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: T12 compression fracture with cauda equina syndrome and spinal cord compression. OPERATION PERFORMED: Decompressive laminectomy at T12 with bilateral facetectomies, decompression of T11 and T12 nerve roots bilaterally with posterolateral fusion supplemented with allograft bone chips and pedicle screws and rods with crosslink Synthes Click'X System using 6.5 mm diameter x 40 mm length T11 screws and L1 screws, 7 mm diameter x 45 mm length. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 400 mL, replaced 2 units of packed cells. Preoperative hemoglobin was less than 10. DRAINS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: With the patient prepped and draped in a routine fashion in the prone position on laminae support, an x-ray was taken and demonstrated a needle at the T12-L1 interspace. An incision was made over the posterior spinous process of T10, T11, T12, L1, and L2. A Weitlaner retractor was placed and cutting Bovie current was used to incise the fascia overlying the dorsal spinous process of T10, T11, T12, L1, and L2. An additional muscular ligamentous attachment was dissected free bilaterally with cutting Bovie current osteotome and Cobb elevator. The cerebellar retractors were placed in the wound and obvious deformation of the lamina particularly on the left side at T12 was apparent. Initially, on the patient's left side, pedicle screws were placed in T11 and L1. The inferior articular facet was removed at T11 and an awl placed at the proximal location of the pedicle. Placement confirmed with biplanar coaxial fluoroscopy. The awl was in appropriate location and using a pedicle finder under fluoroscopic control, the pedicle was probed to the mid portion of the body of T11. A 40-mm Click'X screw, 6.5 mm diameter with rod holder was then threaded into the T11 vertebral body. Attention was next turned to the L1 level on the left side and the junction of the transverse processes with the superior articular facet and intra-articular process was located using an AM-8 dissecting tool, AM attachment to the Midas Rex instrumentation. The area was decorticated, an awl was placed, and under fluoroscopic biplanar imaging noted to be at the pedicle in L1. Using a pedicle probe, the pedicle was then probed to the mid body of L1 and a 7-mm diameter 45-mm in length Click'X Synthes screw with rod holder was placed in the L1 vertebral body. At this point, an elongated rod was placed on the left side for purposes of distraction should it be felt necessary in view of the MRI findings of significant compression on the patient's ventral canal on the right side. Attention was next turned to the right side and it should be noted that the dissection above was carried out with operating room microscope and at this point, the intraspinous process ligament superior to the posterior spinous process at T12 was noted be completely disrupted on a traumatic basis. The anteroposterior spinous process ligament superior to the T12 was incised with cutting Bovie current and the posterior spinous process at T12 removed with a Leksell rongeur. It was necessary to remove portion of the posterior spinous process at T11 for a full visualization of the involved laminar fractures at T12. At this point, a laminectomy was performed using 45-degree Kerrison rongeur, both 2 mm and 4 mm, and Leksell rongeur. There was an epidural hematoma encountered to the midline and left side at the mid portion of the T12 laminectomy and this was extending superiorly to the T11-T12 interlaminar space. Additionally, there was marked instability of the facets bilaterally at T12 and L1. These facets were removed with 45-degree Kerrison rongeur and Leksell rongeur. Bony compression both superiorly and laterally from fractured bony elements was removed with 45-degree Kerrison rongeur until the thecal sac was completely decompressed. The exiting nerve roots at T11 and T12 were visualized and followed with Frazier dissectors, and these nerve roots were noted to be completely free. Hemostasis was controlled with bipolar coagulation. At this point, a Frazier dissector could be passed superiorly, inferiorly, medially, and laterally to the T11-T12 nerve roots bilaterally, and the thecal sac was noted to be decompressed both superiorly and inferiorly, and noted to be quite pulsatile. A #4 Penfield was then used to probe the floor of the spinal canal, and no significant ventral compression remained on the thecal sac. Copious antibiotic irrigation was used and at this point on the patient's right side, pedicle screws were placed at T11 and L1 using the technique described for a left-sided pedicle screw placement. The anatomic landmarks being the transverse process at T11, the inferior articulating facet, and the lateral aspect of the superior articular facet for T11 and at L1, the transverse process, the junction of the intra-articular process and the facet joint. With the screws placed on the left side, the elongated rod was removed from the patient's right side along with the locking caps, which had been placed. It was felt that distraction was not necessary. A 75-mm rod could be placed on the patient's left side with reattachment of the locking screw heads with the rod cap locker in place; however, it was necessary to cut a longer rod for the patient's right side with the screws slightly greater distance apart ultimately settling on a 90-mm rod. The locking caps were placed on the right side and after all 4 locking caps were placed, the locking cap screws were tied to the cold weld. Fluoroscopic examination demonstrated no evidence of asymmetry at the intervertebral space at T11-T12 or T12-L1 with excellent positioning of the rods and screws. A crosslink approximately 60 mm in width was then placed between the right and left rods, and all 4 screws were tightened. It should be noted that prior to the placement of the rods, the patient's autologous bone, which had been removed during laminectomy portion of the procedure and cleansed off soft tissue and morcellated was packed in the posterolateral space after decortication had been effected on the transverse processes at T11, T12, and L1 with AM-8 dissecting tool, AM attachment as well as the lateral aspects of the facet joints. This was done bilaterally prior to placement of the rods. Following placement of the rods as noted above, allograft bone chips were packed in addition on top of the patient's own allograft in these posterolateral gutters. Gelfoam was used to cover the thecal sac and at this point, the wound was closed by approximating the deep muscle with 0 Vicryl suture. The fascia was closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture, subcutaneous layer was closed with 2-0 Vicryl suture, subcuticular layer was closed with 2-0 inverted interrupted Vicryl suture, and the skin approximated with staples. The patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well without complications."
Orthopedic," EXAM:MRI LEFT FOOT CLINICAL: A 49-year-old female with ankle pain times one month, without a specific injury. Patient complains of moderate to severe pain, worse with standing or walking on hard surfaces, with tenderness to palpation at the plantar aspect of the foot and midfoot region and tenderness over the course of the posterior tibialis tendon. FINDINGS: Received for second opinion interpretations is an MRI examination performed on 05/27/2005. There is edema of the subcutis adipose space extending along the medial and lateral aspects of the ankle. There is edema of the subcutis adipose space posterior to the Achilles tendon. Findings suggest altered biomechanics with crural fascial strains. There is tendinosis of the posterior tibialis tendon as it rounds the tip of the medial malleolus with mild tendon thickening. There is possible partial surface tearing of the anterior aspect of the tendon immediately distal to the tip of the medial malleolus (axial inversion recovery image #16) which is a possible hypertrophic tear less than 50% in cross sectional diameter. The study has been performed with the foot in neutral position. Confirmation of this possible partial tendon tear would require additional imaging with the foot in a plantar flexed position with transaxial images of the posterior tibialis tendon as it rounds the tip of the medial malleolus oriented perpendicular to the course of the posterior tibialis tendon. There is minimal synovitis of the flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus tendon sheaths consistent with flexor splinting but intrinsically normal tendons. Normal peroneal tendons. There is tendinosis of the tibialis anterior tendon with thickening but no demonstrated tendon tear. Normal extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum tendons. Normal Achilles tendon. There is a low-lying soleus muscle that extends to within 2cm of the teno-osseous insertion of the Achilles tendon. Normal distal tibiofibular syndesmotic ligamentous complex. Normal lateral, subtalar and deltoid ligamentous complexes. There are no erosions of the inferior neck of the talus and there are no secondary findings of a midfoot pronating force. Normal plantar fascia. There is no plantar calcaneal spur. There is venous engorgement of the plantar veins of the foot extending along the medial and lateral plantar cutaneous nerves which may be acting as intermittent entrapping lesions upon the medial and lateral plantar cutaneous nerves. Normal tibiotalar, subtalar, talonavicular and calcaneocuboid articulations. The metatarsophalangeal joint of the hallux was partially excluded from the field-of-view of this examination. IMPRESSION: Tendinosis of the posterior tibialis tendon with tendon thickening and possible surface fraying / tearing of the tendon immediately distal to the tip of the medial malleolus, however, confirmation of this finding would require additional imaging. Minimal synovitis of the flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus tendon sheaths, consistent with flexor splinting. Edema of the subcutis adipose space along the medial and lateral aspects of the ankle suggesting altered biomechanics and crural fascial strain. Mild tendinosis of the tibialis anterior tendon with mild tendon thickening. Normal plantar fascia and no plantar fasciitis. Venous engorgement of the plantar veins of the foot which may be acting as entrapping lesions upon the medial and lateral plantar cutaneous nerves."
Orthopedic," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left elbow pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 17-year-old male was fighting with some other kids in Juvenile Hall when he felt some pain in his left elbow, causing sudden pain. He also has pain in his left ankle, but he is able to walk normally. He has had previous pain in his left knee. He denies any passing out, any neck pain at this time even though he did get hit in the head. He has no chest or abdominal pain. Apparently, no knives or guns were involved. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He has had toe problems and left knee pain in the past. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No coughing, sputum production, dyspnea or chest pain. No vomiting or abdominal pain. No visual changes. No neurologic deficits other than some numbness in his left hand. SOCIAL HISTORY: He is in Juvenile Hall for about 25 more days. He is a nonsmoker. ALLERGIES: MORPHINE. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Abilify. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Stable. HEENT: PERRLA. EOMI. Conjunctivae anicteric. Skull is normocephalic. He is not complaining of bruising. HEENT: TMs and canals are normal. There is no Battle sign. NECK: Supple. He has good range of motion. Spinal processes are normal to palpation. LUNGS: Clear. CARDIAC: Regular rate. No murmurs or rubs. EXTREMITIES: Left elbow is tender. He does not wish to move it at all. Shoulder and clavicle are within normal limits. Wrist is normal to inspection. He does have some pain to palpation. Hand has good capillary refill. He seems to have decreased sensation in all three dermatomes. He has moderately good abduction of all fingers. He has moderate opponens strength with his thumb. He has very good extension of all of his fingers with good strength. We did an x-ray of his elbow. He has a spiral fracture of the distal one-third of the humerus, about 13 cm in length. The proximal part looks like it is in good position. The distal part has about 6 mm of displacement. There is no significant angulation. The joint itself appears to be intact. The fracture line ends where it appears above the joint. I do not see any extra blood in the joint. I do not see any anterior or posterior Siegert sign. I spoke with Dr. X. He suggests we go ahead and splint him up and he will follow the patient up. At this point, it does not seem like there needs to be any surgical revision. The chance of a compartment syndrome seems very low at this time. Using 4-inch Ortho-Glass and two assistants, we applied a posterior splint to immobilize his fingers, hand, and wrist all the way up to his elbow to well above the elbow. He had much better comfort once this was applied. There was good color to his fingers and again, much better comfort. Once that was on, I took some 5-inch Ortho-Glass and put in extra reinforcement around the elbow so he would not be moving it, straightening it or breaking the fiberglass. We then gave him a sling. We gave him #2 Vicodin p.o. and #4 to go. Gave him a prescription for #15 more and warned him to take it only at nighttime and use Tylenol or Motrin, and ice in the daytime. I gave him the name and telephone number of Dr. X whom they can follow up with. They were warned to come back here if he has increasing neurologic deficits in his hands or any new problems. DIAGNOSES: 1. Fracture of the humerus, spiral. 2. Possible nerve injuries to the radial and median nerve, possibly neurapraxia. 3. Psychiatric disorder, unspecified. DISPOSITION: The patient will follow up as mentioned above. They can return here anytime as needed."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical disk protrusions at C5-C6 and C6-C7, cervical radiculopathy, and cervical pain. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical disk protrusions at C5-C6 and C6-C7, cervical radiculopathy, and cervical pain. PROCEDURES: C5-C6 and C6-C7 anterior cervical discectomy (two levels) C5-C6 and C6-C7 allograft fusions. A C5-C7 anterior cervical plate fixation (Sofamor Danek titanium window plate) intraoperative fluoroscopy used and intraoperative microscopy used. Intraoperative SSEP and EMG monitoring used. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: This lady presented with history of cervical pain associated with cervical radiculopathy with cervical and left arm pain, numbness, weakness, with MRI showing significant disk protrusions with the associate complexes at C5-C6 and C6-C7 with associated cervical radiculopathy. After failure of conservative treatment, this patient elected to undergo surgery. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the OR and after adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was placed supine on the OR table with the head of the bed about 10 degrees. A shoulder roll was placed and the head supported on a donut support. The cervical region was prepped and draped in the standard fashion. A transverse cervical incision was made from the midline, which was lateral to the medial edge of the sternocleidomastoid two fingerbreadths above the right clavicle. In a transverse fashion, the incision was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and through the platysmata and a subplatysmal dissection done. Then, the dissection continued medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and then medial to the carotid artery to the prevertebral fascia, which was gently dissected and released superiorly and inferiorly. Spinal needles were placed into the displaced C5-C6 and C6-C7 to confirm these disk levels using lateral fluoroscopy. Following this, monopolar coagulation was used to dissect the medial edge of the longus colli muscles off the adjacent vertebrae between C5-C7 and then the Trimline retractors were placed to retract the longus colli muscles laterally and blunt retractors were placed superiorly and inferiorly. A #15 scalpel was used to do a discectomy at C5-C6 from endplate-to-endplate and uncovertebral joint. On the uncovertebral joint, a pituitary rongeur was used to empty out any disk material ____________ to further remove the disk material down to the posterior aspect. This was done under the microscope. A high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the endplates to the posterior aspect of the annulus. A blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and it was gently released using the #15 scalpel and then Kerrison punches 1-mm and then 2-mm were used to decompress further disk calcified material at the C5-C6 level. This was done bilaterally to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent neuroforamen. Then, at the C6-C7 level, in a similar fashion, #15 blade was used to do a discectomy from uncovertebral joint to uncovertebral joint and from endplate-to-endplate using a #15 scalpel to enter the disk space and then the curette was then used to remove the disk calcified material in the endplate, and then high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the disk space down to the posterior aspect of the annulus where a blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament which was gently released. Then using the Kerrison punches, we used 1-mm and 2-mm, to remove disk calcified material, which was extending more posteriorly to the left and the right. This was gently removed and decompressed to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent nerve roots. With this done, the wound was irrigated. Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation. Vertebral body distraction pins were then placed to the vertebral body of C5 and C7 for vertebral distraction and then a 6-mm allograft performed grafts were taken and packed in either aspect with demineralized bone matrix and this was tapped in flush with the vertebral bodies above and below C5-C6 and C6-C7 discectomy sites. Then, the vertebral body distraction pins were gently removed to allow for graft seating and compression and then the anterior cervical plate (Danek windows titanium plates) was then taken and sized and placed. A temporary pin was initially used to align the plate and then keeping the position and then two screw holes were drilled in the vertebral body of C5, two in the vertebral body of C6, and two in the vertebral body of C7. The holes were then drilled and after this self-tapping screws were placed into the vertebral body of C5, C6, and C7 across the plate to allow the plate to fit and stay flush with the vertebral body between C5, C6, and C7. With this done, operative fluoroscopy was used to check good alignment of the graft, screw, and plate, and then the wound was irrigated. Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation and then the locking screws were tightened down. A #10 round Jackson-Pratt drain was placed into the prevertebral space and brought out from a separate stab wound skin incision site. Then, the platysma was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl inverted interrupted stitches and the skin closed with 4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. Throughout the procedure, the microscope had been used for the disk decompression and high-speed drilling. In addition, intraoperative SSEP, EMG monitoring, and motor-evoked potentials remained stable throughout the procedure. The patient remained stable throughout the procedure."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ruptured distal biceps tendon, right elbow. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ruptured distal biceps tendon, right elbow. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Repair of distal biceps tendon, right elbow. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to OR, Room #2 and administered a general anesthetic. The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual manner. A sterile tourniquet was placed on the proximal aspect of the right upper extremity. The extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg. Tourniquet time was 74 minutes. A curvilinear incision was made in the antecubital fossa of the right elbow down through the skin. Hemostasis was achieved utilizing electrocautery. Subcutaneous fat was separated and the skin flaps elevated. The _________ was identified. It was incised. The finger was placed approximately up the anterior aspect of the arm and the distal aspect of the biceps tendon was found. There was some serosanguineous fluid from the previous rupture. This area was suctioned clean. The biceps tendon ends were then placed over a sterile tongue blade and were then sharply cut approximately 5 mm to 7 mm from the tip to create a fresh surface. At this point, the #2 fiber wire was then passed through the tendon. Two fiber wires were utilized in a Krackow-type suture. Once this was completed, dissection was taken digitally down into the antecubital fossa in the path where the biceps tendon had been previously. The radial tuberosity was palpated. Just ulnar to this, a curved hemostat was passed through the soft tissues and was used to tent the skin on the radial aspect of the elbow. A skin incision was made over this area. Approximately two inches down to the skin and subcutaneous tissues, the fascia was split and the extensor muscle was also split. A stat was then attached through the tip of that stat and passed back up through the antecubital fossa. The tails of the fiber wire suture were grasped and pulled down through the second incision. At this point, they were placed to the side. Attention was directed at exposure of the radial tuberosity with a forearm fully pronated. The tuberosity came into view. The margins were cleared with periosteal elevator and sharp dissection. Utilizing the power bur, a trough approximately 1.5 cm wide x 7 mm to 8 mm high was placed in the radial tuberosity. Three small drill holes were then placed along the margin for passage of the suture. The area was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution. A #4-0 pullout wire was utilized to pass the sutures through the drill holes, one on each outer hole and two in the center hole. The elbow was flexed and the tendon was then pulled into the trough with the forearm supinated. The suture was tied over the bone islands. Both wounds were then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry. Muscle fascia was closed with running #2-0 Vicryl suture on the lateral incision followed by closure of the skin with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and small staples. The anterior incision was approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl for Subq. and then skin was approximated with small staples. Both wounds were infiltrated with a total of 30 cc of 0.25% Marcaine solution for postop analgesia. A bulky fluff dressing was applied to the elbow, followed by application of a long-arm plaster splint maintaining the forearm in the supinated position. Tourniquet was inflated prior to application of the splint. Circulatory status returned to the extremity immediately. The patient was awakened. He was rather boisterous during his awakening, but care was taken to protect the right upper extremity. He was then transferred to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hemarthrosis, left knee, status post total knee replacement, rule out infection. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hemarthrosis, left knee, status post total knee replacement, rule out infection. OPERATIONS: 1. Arthrotomy, left total knee. 2. Irrigation and debridement, left knee. 3. Polyethylene exchange, left knee. COMPLICATION: None. TOURNIQUET TIME: 58 minutes. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: This patient underwent an uncomplicated left total knee replacement. Postoperatively, unfortunately did not follow up with PT/INR blood test and he was taking Coumadin. His INR was seemed to elevated and developed hemarthrosis. Initially, it did look very benign, although over the last 24 hours it did become irritable and inflamed, and he therefore was indicated with the above-noted procedure. This procedure as well as alternatives was discussed in length with the patient and he understood them well. Risks and benefits were also discussed. Risks such as bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgeries, chronic pain with range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of need for total knee revision, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed. He understood them well. All questions were answered and he signed consent for the procedure as described. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was placed on operating table and general anesthesia was achieved. The left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. The leg was elevated and the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg. A longitudinal incision was then made and carried down through subcutaneous tissues. This was made through the prior incision site. There were some fatty necrotic tissues through the incision region and all necrotic tissue was debrided sharply on both sides of the incision site. Medial and lateral flaps were then made. The prior suture was identified, the suture removed and then a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was then performed. Effusion within the knee was noted. All hematoma was evacuated. I then did flex the knee and removed the polyethylene. Once the polyethylene was removed I did irrigate the knee with total of 9 liters of antibiotic solution. Further debridement was performed of all inflamed tissue and thickened synovial tissue. A 6 x 16-mm Stryker polyethylene was then snapped back in position. The knee has excellent stability in all planes and I did perform a light manipulation to improve the flexion of the knee. Further irrigation was performed on the all soft tissue in the knee with additional 3 liters of normal saline. The knee was placed in a flexed position and the extensor mechanism was reapproximated using #2 Ethibond suture in a figure-of-eight manner. The subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated in layers using #1 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was reapproximated using staples. Prior to closure a Hemovac drain was inserted through a superolateral approach into the knee joint. No complications were encountered throughout the procedure, and the patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Cervical spondylosis C5-C6 greater than C6-C7 (721.0). 2. Neck pain, progressive (723.1) with right greater than left radiculopathy (723.4). POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Cervical spondylosis C5-C6 greater than C6-C7 (721.0). 2. Neck pain, progressive (723.1) with right greater than left radiculopathy (723.4), surgical findings confirmed. PROCEDURES: 1. Anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 and C6-C7 for neural decompression (63075, 63076). 2. Anterior interbody fusion at C5-C6 and C6-C7 (22554, 22585) utilizing Bengal cages x2 (22851). 3. Anterior instrumentation by Uniplate construction C5, C6, and C7 (22845); with intraoperative x-ray x2. ANESTHESIA: General. OPERATIONS: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position where general anesthesia was administered. Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in the routine sterile fashion. A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner and then with only blunt dissection, the prevertebral space was encountered and localizing intraoperative x-ray was obtained once cauterized the longus colli muscle bilaterally allowed for the placement along its mesial portion of self-retaining retractors for exposure of tissues. Prominent anterior osteophytes once identified and compared to preoperative studies were removed at C5-C6 and then at C6-C7 with rongeur, allowing for an annulotomy with an #11 blade through collapsed disc space at C5-6, and even more collapsed at C6-C7. Gross instability appeared and though minimally at both interspaces and residual disc were removed then with the straight disc forceps providing a discectomy at both levels, sending to Pathology in a routine fashion as disc specimen. This was sent separately and allowed for residual disc removal of power drill where drilling extended in normal cortical and cancellous elements of the C5 and C6 interspaces and at C6-C7 removing large osteophytes and process, residual osteophytes from which were removed finally with 1 and 2 mm micro Kerrison rongeurs allowing for excision of other hypertrophied ligament posteriorly as well. This allowed for the bulging into the interspace of the dura, sign of decompressed status, and this was done widely bilaterally to decompress the nerve roots themselves and this was assured by inspection with a double ball dissector as needed. At no time during the case was there evidence of CSF leakage and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam and subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation as well as Surgifoam. Once hemostasis well achieved, Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements of appropriate size, and this was countersunk into position and quite tightly applied it at first C5-C6, then secondly at C6-C7. These were checked and found to be well applied and further stability was then added by placement nonetheless of a Uniplate of appropriate size. The appropriate size screws and post-placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements and removal of osteophytes, etc. The wound was again irrigated with antibiotic solution, inspected, and finally closed in a multiple layered closure by approximation of platysma with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and the skin with subcuticular stitch of #4-0 Vicryl incorporating a Penrose drain from vertebral space externally through the skin wound and safety pin, and later incorporated itself into sterile bandage. Once the bandage was placed, the patient was taken, extubated from the operating room to the Recovery area, having in stable, but guarded condition. At the conclusion of the case, all instrument, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct. There were no intraoperative complications of any type."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe low back pain. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe low back pain. OPERATIONS PERFORMED: Anterior lumbar fusion, L4-L5, L5-S1, PEEK vertebral spacer, structural autograft from L5 vertebral body, BMP and anterior plate. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 50 mL. DRAINS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS: Dr. X made the approach and once we were at the L5-S1 disk space, we removed the disk and we placed a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer filled with a core of bone taken from the L5 vertebral body. This was filled with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug. At L4-L5, we used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer with structural autograft and BMP, and then we placed a two-level 87-mm Integra sacral plate with 28 x 6-mm screws, two each at L4 and L5 and 36 x 6-mm screws at S1. OPERATION IN DETAIL: The patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Dr. X made the approach, and once the L5-S1 disk space was identified, we incised this with a knife and then removed a large core of bone taking rotating cutters. I was able to remove additional disk space and score the vertebral bodies. The rest of the disk removal was done with the curette, scraping the endplates. I tried various sized spacers, and at this point, we exposed the L5 body and took a dowel from the body and filled the hole with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug. Half of this was used to fill the spacer at L5-S1, BMP was placed in the spacer as well and then it was tapped into place. We then moved the vessels over the opposite way approaching the L4-L5 disk space laterally, and the disk was removed in a similar fashion and we also used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer, but this is the variety that we could put in from one side. This was filled with bone and BMP as well. Once this was done, we were able to place an 87-mm Integra sacral plate down over the three vertebral bodies and place these screws. Following this, bleeding points were controlled and Dr. X proceeded with the closure of the abdomen. SUMMARY: This is a 51-year-old man who reports 15-year history of low back pain and intermittent bilateral leg pain and achiness. He has tried multiple conservative treatments including physical therapy, epidural steroid injections, etc. MRI scan shows a very degenerated disk at L5-S1, less so at L3-L4 and L4-L5. A discogram was positive with the lower 3 levels, but he has pain, which starts below the iliac crest and I feel that the L3-L4 disk is probably that symptomatic. An anterior lumbar interbody fusion was suggested. Procedure, risks, and complications were explained."
Orthopedic," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 18-year-old girl brought in by her father today for evaluation of a right knee injury. She states that approximately 3 days ago while playing tennis she had a non-contact injury in which she injured the right knee. She had immediate pain and swelling. At this time, she complains of pain and instability in the knee. The patient's past medical history is significant for having had an ACL injury to the knee in 2008. She underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by Dr. X at that time, subsequently in the same year she developed laxity of the graft due in part to noncompliance and subsequently, she sought attention from Dr. Y who performed a revision ACL reconstruction at the end of 2008. The patient states she rehabbed the knee well after that and did fine with good stability of the knee until this recent injury. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: She claims no chronic illnesses. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She had an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in 03/2008, and subsequently had a revision ACL reconstruction in 12/2008. She has also had arm surgery when she was 6 years old. MEDICATIONS: She takes no medications on a regular basis ALLERGIES: She is allergic to Keflex and has skin sensitivity to Steri-Strips. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is single. She is a full-time student at University. Uses no tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. She exercises weekly, mainly tennis and swelling. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Significant for recent weight gain, occasional skin rashes. The remainder of her systems negative. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION GENERAL: The patient is 4 foot 10 inches tall, weighs 110 pounds. EXTREMITIES: She ambulates with some difficulty with a marked limp on the right side. Inspection of the knee reveals a significant effusion in the knee. She has difficulty with passive range of motion of the knee secondary to pain. She does have tenderness to palpation at the medial joint line and has a positive Lachman's exam. NEUROVASCULAR: She is neurovascularly intact. IMPRESSION: Right knee injury suggestive of a recurrent anterior cruciate ligament tear, possible internal derangement. PLAN: The patient will be referred for an MRI of the right knee to evaluate the integrity of her revision ACL graft. In the meantime, she will continue to use ice as needed. Moderate her activities and use crutches. She will follow up as soon as the MRI is performed."
Orthopedic," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chronic low back, left buttock and leg pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a pleasant 49-year-old gentleman post lumbar disc replacement from January 2005. Unfortunately, the surgery and interventional procedures have not been helpful in alleviating his pain. He has also tried acupuncture, TENS unit, physical therapy, chiropractic treatment and multiple neuropathic medications including Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro, which he discontinued either due to side effects or lack of effectiveness in decreasing his pain. Most recently, he has had piriformis injections, which did give him a brief period of relief; however, he reports that the Botox procedure that was done on March 8, 2006 has not given him any relief from his buttock pain. He states that approximately 75% of his pain is in his buttock and leg and 25% in his back. He has tried to increase in his activity with walking and does note increased spasm with greater activity in the low back. He rated his pain today as 6/10, describing it is shooting, sharp and aching. It is increased with lifting, prolonged standing or walking and squatting, decreased with ice, reclining and pain medication. It is constant but variable in degree. It continues to affect activities and sleep at night as well as mood at times. He is currently not satisfied completely with his level of pain relief. MEDICATIONS: Kadian 30 mg b.i.d., Zanaflex one-half to one tablet p.r.n. spasm, and Advil p.r.n. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Complete multisystem review was noted and signed in the chart. SOCIAL HISTORY: Unchanged from prior visit. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure 123/87, pulse 89, respirations 18, and weight 220 lbs. He is a well-developed obese male in no acute distress. He is alert and oriented x3, and displays normal mood and affect with no evidence of acute anxiety or depression. He ambulates with normal gait and has normal station. He is able to heel and toe walk. He denies any sensory changes. ASSESSMENT & PLAN: This is a pleasant 49-year-old with chronic pain plus lumbar disk replacement with radiculitis and myofascial complaints. We discussed treatment options at length and he is willing to undergo a trial of Lyrica. He is sensitive to medications based on his past efforts and is given a prescription for 150 mg that he will start at bedtime. We discussed the up taper schedule and he understands that he will have to be on this for some time before we can decide whether or not it is helpful to him. We also briefly touched on the possibility of a spinal cord stimulator trial if this medication is not helpful to him. He will call me if there are any issues with the new prescription and follow in four weeks for reevaluation."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical spondylosis, status post complex anterior cervical discectomy, corpectomy, decompression and fusion. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical spondylosis, status post complex anterior cervical discectomy, corpectomy, decompression and fusion, and potentially unstable cervical spine. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: Application of PMT large halo crown and vest. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None. ANESTHESIA: Local, conscious sedation with Morphine and Versed. COMPLICATIONS: None. Post-fixation x-rays, nonalignment, no new changes. Post-fixation neurologic examination normal. CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is a 41-year-old female who presented to me with severe cervical spondylosis and myelopathy. She was referred to me by Dr. X. The patient underwent a complicated anterior cervical discectomy, 2-level corpectomy, spinal cord decompression and fusion with fibular strut and machine allograft in the large cervical plate. Surgery had gone well, and the patient has done well in the last 2 days. She is neurologically improved and is moving all four extremities. No airway issues. It was felt that the patient was now a candidate for a halo vest placement given that chance of going to the OR were much smaller. She was consented for the procedure, and I sought the help of ABC and felt that a PMT halo would be preferable to a Bremer halo vest. The patient had this procedure done at the bedside, in the SICU room #1. I used a combination of some morphine 1 mg and Versed 2 mg for this procedure. I also used local anesthetic, with 1% Xylocaine and epinephrine a total of 15 to 20 cc. PROCEDURE DETAILS: The patient's head was positioned on some towels, the retroauricular region was shaved, and the forehead and the posterolateral periauricular regions were prepped with Betadine. A large PMT crown was brought in and fixed to the skull with pins under local anesthetic. Excellent fixation achieved. It was lateral to the supraorbital nerves and 1 fingerbreadth above the brows and the ear pinnae. I then put the vest on, by sitting the patient up, stabilizing her neck. The vest was brought in from the front as well and connected. Head was tilted appropriately, slightly extended, and in the midline. All connections were secured and pins were torqued and tightened. During the procedure, the patient did fine with no significant pain. Post-procedure, she is neurologically intact and she remained intact throughout. X-rays of the cervical spine AP, lateral, and swimmer views showed excellent alignment of the hardware construct in the graft with no new changes. The patient will be subjected to a CT scan to further define the alignment, and barring any problems, she will be ambulating with the halo on. The patient will undergo pin site care as per protocol, and likely she will go in the next 2 to 3 days. Her prognosis indeed is excellent, and she is already about 90% or so better from her surgery. She is also on a short course of Decadron, which we will wean off in due course. The matter was discussed with the patient and the patient's family."
Orthopedic," ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Painful right knee status post total knee arthroplasty many years ago. The patient had gradual onset of worsening soreness and pain in this knee. X-ray showed that the poly seems to be worn out significantly in this area. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Status post poly exchange, right knee, total knee arthroplasty. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Poly exchange total knee, right. CONSULTATIONS: Anesthesia managed femoral nerve block on the patient. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with revision right total knee arthroplasty and replacement of patellar and tibial poly components. The patient recovered well after this. Working with PT, she was able to ambulate with minimal assistance. Nerve block was removed by anesthesia. The patient did well on oral pain medications. The patient was discharged home. She is actually going to home with her son who will be able to assist her and look after her for anything she might need. The patient is comfortable with this, understands the therapy regimen, and is very satisfied after the procedure. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS AND MEDICATIONS: The patient is to be discharged home to the care of the son. Diet is regular. Activity, weight bear as tolerated right lower extremity. Continue to do physical therapy exercises. The patient will be discharged home on Coumadin 4 mg a day as the INR was 1.9 on discharge with twice weekly lab checks. Vicodin 5/500 mg take one to two tablets p.o. q.4-6h. Resume home medications. Call the office or return to the emergency room for any concerns including increased redness, swelling, drainage, fever, or any concerns regarding operation or site of incision. The patient is to follow up with Dr. ABC in two weeks."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Displaced left subtrochanteric femur fracture. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Displaced left subtrochanteric femur fracture. OPERATION: Intramedullary rod in the left hip using the Synthes trochanteric fixation nail measuring 11 x 130 degrees with an 85-mm helical blade. COMPLICATIONS: None. TOURNIQUET TIME: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 50 mL. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: The patient suffered a fall at which time she was taken to the emergency room with pain in the lower extremities. She was diagnosed with displaced left subcapital hip fracture, now was asked to consult. With this diagnosis, she was indicated the above-noted procedure. This procedure as well as alternatives to this procedure was discussed at length with the patient and her son, who has the power of attorney, and they understood them well. Risks and benefits were also discussed. Risks include bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerves, risk of further surgery, chronic pain, restricted range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of malunion, risk of nonunion, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of need for altered activities and altered gait, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed. She understood these well and consented, and the son signed the consent for the procedure as described. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved. The patient was then placed in fracture boots and manipulated under fluoroscopic control until we could obtain near anatomic alignment. External positions were felt to be present. At this point, the left hip and left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A guidewire was then placed percutaneously into the tip of the greater trochanter and a small incision was made overlying the guidewire. An overlying drill was inserted to the proper depths. A Synthes 11 x 130 degrees trochanteric fixation that was chosen was placed into the intramedullary canal to the proper depth. Proper rotation was obtained and the guide for the helical blade was inserted. A small incision was made for this as well. A guidewire was inserted and felt to be in proper position, in the posterior aspect of the femoral head, lateral, and the center position on AP. This placed the proper depths and lengths better. The outer cortex was enlarged and an 85-mm helical blade was attached to the proper depths and proper fixation was done. Appropriate size screw was then tightened down. At this point, a distal guide was then placed and drilled across both the cortices. Length was better. Appropriate size screw was then inserted. Proper size and fit of the distal screw was also noted. At this point, on fluoroscopic control, it was confirming in AP and lateral direction. We did a near anatomical alignment to the fracture site and all hardware was properly fixed. Proper size and fit was noted. Excellent bony approximation was noted. At this point, both wounds were thoroughly irrigated, hemostasis confirmed, and closure was then begun. The fascial layers were then reapproximated using #1 Vicryl in a figure-of-eight manner, the subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated in layers using #1 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was reapproximated with staples. The area was then infiltrated with a mixture of a 0.25% Marcaine with Epinephrine and 1% plain lidocaine. Sterile dressing was then applied. No complication was encountered throughout the procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition."
Orthopedic," ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Right tibial plateau fracture. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Right tibial plateau fracture and also medial meniscus tear on the right side. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of right Schatzker III tibial plateau fracture with partial medial meniscectomy. CONSULTATIONS: To rehab, Dr. X and to Internal Medicine for management of multiple medical problems including hypothyroid, diabetes mellitus type 2, bronchitis, and congestive heart failure. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and consented for operation, and taken to the operating room for open reduction and internal fixation of right Schatzker III tibial plateau fracture and partial medial meniscectomy performed without incidence. The patient seemed to be recovering well. The patient spent the next several days on the floor, nonweightbearing with CPM machine in place, developed a brief period of dyspnea, which seems to have resolved and may have been a combination of bronchitis, thick secretions, and fluid overload. The patient was given nebulizer treatment and Lasix increased the same to resolve the problem. The patient was comfortable, stabilized, breathing well. On day #12, was transferred to ABCD. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is to be transferred to ABCD after open reduction and internal fixation of right tibial plateau fracture and partial medial meniscectomy. DIET: Regular. ACTIVITY AND LIMITATIONS: Nonweightbearing to the right lower extremity. The patient is to continue CPM machine while in bed along with antiembolic stockings. The patient will require nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and social work consults. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Resume home medications, but increase Lasix to 80 mg every morning, Lovenox 30 mg subcu daily x2 weeks, Vicodin 5/500 mg one to two every four to six hours p.r.n. pain, Combivent nebulizer every four hours while awake for difficulty breathing, Zithromax one week 250 mg daily, and guaifenesin long-acting one twice a day b.i.d. FOLLOWUP: Follow up with Dr. Y in 7 to 10 days in office. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable."
Orthopedic," INTRODUCTION: The opinions expressed in this report are those of the physician. The opinions do not reflect the opinions of Evergreen Medical Panel, Inc. The claimant was informed that this examination was at the request of the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (L&I). The claimant was also informed that a written report would be sent to L&I, as requested in the assignment letter from the claims manager. The claimant was also informed that the examination was for evaluative purposes only, intended to address specific injuries or conditions as outlined by L&I, and was not intended as a general medical examination. CHIEF COMPLAINTS: This 51-year-old married male presents complaining of some right periscapular discomfort, some occasional neck stiffness, and some intermittent discomfort in his low back relative to an industrial fall that occurred on November 20, 2008. HISTORY OF INDUSTRIAL INJURY: This patient was injured on November 20, 2008. He works at the Purdy Correctional Facility and an inmate had broken some overhead sprinklers, the floor was thus covered with water and the patient slipped landing on the back of his head, then on his back. The patient said he primarily landed on the left side. After the accident he states that he was generally stun and someone at the institute advised him to be evaluated. He went to a Gig Harbor urgent care facility and they sent him on to Tacoma General Hospital. At the Tacoma General, he indicates that a whiplash and a concussion were diagnosed and it was advised that he have a CT scan. The patient describes that he had a brain CT and a dark spot was found. It was recommended that he have a followup MRI and this was done locally and showed a recurrent acoustic neuroma. Before, when the patient initially had developed an acoustic neuroma, the chiropractor had seen the patient and suggested that he have a scan and this was how his original acoustic neuroma was diagnosed back in October 2005. The patient has been receiving adjustments by the chiropractor since and he also has had a few massage treatments. Overall his spine complaints have improved substantially. After the fall, he also saw at Prompt Care in the general Bremerton area, XYZ, an Osteopathic Physician and she examined him and released him full duty and also got an orthopedic consult from XYZ. She ordered an MRI of his neck. Cervically this showed that he had a mild disc bulge at C4-C5, but this actually was the same test that diagnosed a recurrent acoustic neuroma and the patient now is just recovering from neurosurgical treatment for this recurrent acoustic neuroma and some radiation is planned. Since 2002 the patient has been seeing the chiropractor, XYZ for general aches and pain and this has included some treatments on his back and neck. CURRENT SYMPTOMS: The patient describes his current pain as being intermittent. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Illnesses: The patient had a diagnosis in 2005 of an acoustic neuroma. It was benign, but treated neurosurgically. In February 2004 and again in August 2009 he has had additional treatments for recurrence and he currently has some skull markers in place because radiation is planned as a followup, although the tumor was still indicated to be benign. Operations: He has a history of an old mastoidectomy. He has a past history of removal of an acoustic neuroma in 2005 as noted. Medications: The patient takes occasional Tylenol and occasional Aleve. Substance Use: Tobacco: He does not smoke cigarettes. Alcohol: He drinks about five beers a week. FAMILY HISTORY: His father died of mesothelioma and his mother died of Lou Gehrig's disease. SOCIOECONOMIC HISTORY: Marital Status and Dependents: The patient has been married three times; longest marriage is of two years duration. He has two children. These dependents are ages 15 and twins and are his wife's dependents. Education: The patient has bachelor's degree. Military History: He served six years in the army and received an honorable discharge. Work History: He has worked at Purdy Correctional Institute in Gig Harbor for 19 years. CHART REVIEW: Review of the chart indicates a date of injury of November 20, 2008. He was seen at Tacoma General Hospital with a diagnosis of head contusion and cervical strain. He had a CT of his head done because of a fall with possible loss of consciousness, which showed a left cerebellar hypodensity and further evaluation was recommended. He has a history of an old mastoidectomy. He was then seen on November 24, 2008 by XYZ at Prompt Care on November 24, 2008. There is no clearcut history that he had lost consciousness. He has a past history of removal of an acoustic neuroma in 2005 as noted. A diagnosis of concussion and cervical strain status post fall was made along with an underlying history of abnormal CT and previous resection of an acoustic neuroma. Some symptoms of loss of balance and confusion were noted. She recommended additional testing and neurologic evaluation. The notes from the treating chiropractor begin on November 24, 2008. Adjustments are given to the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. He was seen back by XYZ on December 9, 2008 and he had been released to full duties. It was recognized the new MRI suggested recurrence of the acoustic neuroma and he was advised to seek further care in this regard. There were some concerns of his feeling of being wobbly since the fall which might be related to the recurrent neuroma. He continued to have chiropractic adjustments. He was seen back at Prompt Care on January 8, 2009. Dr. X indicated that she thought most of his symptoms were related to the tumor, but that the cervical and thoracic stiffness were from the fall. A followup note by his chiropractor on January 26, 2009 indicates that cervical x-rays have been taken and that continued chiropractic adjustments along with manual traction would be carried out. On April 13, 2009, he was seen again at Prompt Care for his cervical and thoracic strain. He was indicated to be improving and there was suggestion that he has some physical therapy and an orthopedic consult was felt appropriate. Therapy was not carried out and obviously was then involved with the treatment of his recurrent neuroma. On April 17, 2009, he was seen by Dr. X, another chiropractor for consultation and further chiropractic treatments were recommended based on cervical and thoracolumbar subluxation complexes and strain. A repeat consult was carried out on April 29, 2009 by XYZ. He felt that this was hyperextension cervical injury. It might take a period of time to recover. He mentioned that the patient might have a slight ulnar neuropathy. He felt the patient was capable of full duty and the patient was at that time having ongoing treatment for his neuroma. This concludes the chart review. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is 6 feet in height, weighs 255 pounds. Orthopedic Examination: He can walk with a normal gait, but he has, as indicated, a positive Romberg test and he himself has noticed that if he closes his eyes he loses his balance. Overall the patient is a seemingly good historian. There is a visible 3 cm scar at the left base of the neck near the hairline and there are multiple areas where his head has been shaved both anteriorly and posteriorly. These are secondary to drawing for the skull markers. There is a scar behind the patient's left ear from the original treatment of the acoustic neuroma. This was well healed. The patient can perform a toe-heel gait without difficulty. One visibly can see that he has some facial asymmetry and he indicates that the acoustic neuroma has caused some numbness in the left side of his face and also some asymmetry that is now recovering. The patient states he now thinks his recovery is going to get disregarded and that the facial asymmetry and numbness developed from the first surgery he had. The patient has a full range of motion in both of his shoulders. The patient has a full range of motion in his lumbar spine to include 90 degrees of forward bend, lateral bending of 30 degrees in either direction and extension of 10 degrees. There is full range of motion in the patient's cervical spine to include flexion of 50 degrees at which time he can touch his chin on his chest. He extends 40 degrees, laterally bends 30 degrees, and rotates to 80 degrees in either direction. There is slight tenderness on palpating over the right cervical musculature. There is no evidence of any cervical or lumbar muscle spasms. Reflexes in the upper extremities include 1+ biceps and triceps and 1+ brachioradialis. Knee jerks are 2+ and ankle jerks are 1+. Tinel's test was tested at the elbow, it is negative bilaterally with percussion; however, he has slight tingling bilaterally. The patient's grip tested with a Jamar dynamometer increases from 70 to 80 pounds bilaterally. Sensory testing of lower extremities reveal that the patient has slightly decreased sensation to sharp stimulus in his dorsal aspect of the right first toe and a lesser extent to the left. Testing of muscle strength in the upper and lower extremities is normal. The patient upper arms measured four fingerbreadths above the flexion crease of the elbow measure 35 cm bilaterally. The forearms measured four fingerbreadths below the flexion crease of the elbow measure 30 cm bilaterally. The thighs measured four fingerbreadths above the superior pole of the patella measure 48 cm and the lower legs measured four fingerbreadths below the tibial tubercles measure 41 cm. Pressure on the vertex of the head does not bother the patient. Axial loading is negative. As already indicated straight leg raising is entirely negative both sitting and lying for any radiculitis. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: X-rays the patient brings with him taken by his treating chiropractor dated 11/24/08 showed that there appears to be a little bit of narrowing of the L4-5 disc space. The hip joints are normal. Views of his thoracic spine are normal. Cervical x-rays are in the file. These are of intermittent quality, but the views do show a very slight degree of anterior spurring at the C4-5 with possible slight narrowing of the disc. There is a view of the right shoulder that is unremarkable. CONCLUSIONS: The accepted condition under the claim is a sprain of the neck, thoracic, and lumbar. DIAGNOSES: Diagnosis based on today's examination is a sprain of the cervical spine and lumbar spine superimposed upon some early degenerative changes. Additional diagnosis is one of recurrent acoustic neuroma, presumably benign with upcoming additional treatment of radiation plan. The patient also has a significant degree overweight for his height and it will be improved as he himself recognizes by some weight loss and exercise. DISCUSSION: He is fixed and stable at this time and his industrial case can be closed relative to his industrial injury of November 20, 2008. Further chiropractic treatments would be entirely palliative and serve no additional medical purpose due to the fact that he has very minimal symptoms and a basis for these symptoms based on mild or early degenerative changes in both cervical and lumbar spine.

Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Left carpal tunnel syndrome (354.0). 2. Left ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow (354.2). POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Left carpal tunnel syndrome (354.0). 2. Left ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow (354.2). OPERATIONS PERFORMED: 1. Left carpal tunnel release (64721). 2. Left ulnar nerve anterior submuscular transposition at the elbow (64718). 3. Lengthening of the flexor pronator muscle mass in the proximal forearm to accommodate the submuscular position of the ulnar nerve (25280). ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with intubation. INDICATIONS OF PROCEDURE: This patient is insulin-dependant diabetic. He is also has end-stage renal failure and has chronic hemodialysis. Additionally, the patient has had prior heart transplantation. He has been evaluated for ischemic problems to both lower extremities and also potentially to the left upper extremity. However, it is our contention that this patient's prime problem of the left upper extremity is probably neuropathic ulcers from total lack of sensation along the ulnar border of the left little finger. These started initially as unrecognized paper cuts. Additionally, the patient appears to have a neurogenic pain affecting predominantly the areas innovated by the median nerve, but also to the little finger. Finally, this patient does indeed have occlusive arterial disease to the left upper extremity in that he has a short segment radial artery occlusion and he does appear to have a narrowed segment in the ulnar artery, but the arteriogram shows distal perfusion down the ulnar border of the hand and into the little finger. Thus, we have planned to proceed first with nerve entrapment releases and potentially at the later date do arterial reconstruction if deemed necessary. Thirdly, this patient does have chronic distal ischemic problems with evidence of &quot;ping-pong ball sign&quot; due to fat atrophy at the finger tips and some periodic cracking and ulceration at the tips of the fingers. However, this patient has no clinical sign at all of tissue necrosis at the finger tips at this time. The patient has also previously had an arteriovenous shunt in the forearm, which has been deactivated within the last 3 weeks. Thus, we planned to bring this patient to the operating room for left carpal tunnel release as well as anterior submuscular transposition of the ulnar nerve. This patient had electro diagnostic studies performed, which showed severe involvement of both the ulnar nerve at the elbow and the medial nerve at the carpal tunnel. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After general anesthesia being induced and the patient intubated, he is given intravenous Ancef. The entire left upper extremity is prepped with Betadine all the way to the axilla and draped in a sterile fashion. A sterile tourniquet and webril are placed higher on the arm. The arm is then exsanguinated with Ace bandage and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. I started first at the carpal tunnel release and a longitudinal curvilinear incision is made parallel to the thenar crease and stopping short of the wrist flexion crease. Dissection continued through subcutaneous tissue to the palmer aponeurosis, which is divided longitudinally from distal to proximal. I next encountered the transverse carpal ligament, which in turn is also divided longitudinally from distal to proximal, and the proximal most division of the transverse carpal ligament is done under direct vision into the distal forearm. Having confirmed a complete release of the transverse carpal ligament, I next evaluated the contents of the carpal tunnel. The synovium was somewhat thickened, but not unduly so. There was some erythema along the length of the median nerve, indicating chronic compression. The motor branch of the median nerve was clearly identified. The contents of the carpal canal were retracted in a radial direction and the floor of the canal evaluated and no other extrinsic compressive pathology was identified. The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and wound edges were reapproximated with interrupted 5-0 nylon sutures. I next turned my attention to the cubital tunnel problem and a longitudinal curvilinear incision is made on the medial aspect of the arm extending into the forearm with the incision passing directly between the olecranon and the medial epicondyle. Dissection continues through fascia and then skin clamps are elevated to the level of the fascia on the flexor pronator muscle mass. In the process of elevating this skin flap I elevated and deactivated shunt together with the skin flap. I now gained access to the radial border of the flexor pronator muscle mass, dissected down the radial side, until I identified the median nerve. I turned my attention back to the ulnar nerve and it is located immediately posterior to the medial intramuscular septum in the upper arm, and I dissected it all the way proximally until I encountered the location with ulnar the nerve passed from the anterior to the posterior compartments in the upper portion of the arm. The entire medial intramuscular septum is now excised. The ulnar nerve is mobilized between vessel loops and includes with it is accompanying vascular structures. Larger penetrating vascular tributaries to the muscle ligated between hemoclips. I continued to mobilize the nerve around the medial epicondyle and then took down the aponeurosis between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris and continued to dissect the nerve between the FCU muscle fibers. The nerve is now mobilized and I had retained the large muscular branches and dissected them out into the muscle and also proximally using microvascular surgical techniques. In this way, the nerve was able to be mobilized between vessiloops and easily transposed anterior to the flexor pronator muscle mass in tension free manner. I now made an oblique division of the entire flexor pronator muscle mass proximally in the forearm and the ulnar nerve was able to be transposed deep to the muscle in a nonkinking and tension-free manner. Because of the oblique incision into the flexor pronator muscle mass the muscle edges were now able to slide on each other. So that in effect a lengthening is performed. Fascial repair is done with interrupted figure-of-eight 0-Ethibond sutures. I now ranged the arm through the full range of flexion and extension at the elbow and there was no significant kinking on the nerve and there was a tension-free coverage of the muscle without any impingement on the nerve. The entire arm is next wrapped with a Kerlix wrap and I released the tourniquet and after allowing the reactive hyperemia to subside, I then unwrap the arm and check for hemostasis. Wound is copiously irrigated with normal saline and then a 15-French Round Blake drainage placed through a separate stab incision and laid along the length of the wound. A layered wound closure is done with interrupted Vicryl subcutaneously, and a running subcuticular Monocryl to the skin. A 0.25% plain Marcaine then used to infiltrate all the wound edges to help with post operative analgesia and dressings take the form of Adaptic impregnated Bacitracin ointment, followed by a well-fluffed gauze and a Kerlix dressing and confirming Kerlix and webril, and an above elbow sugar-tong splint is applied extending to the support of the wrist. Fingers and femoral were free to move. The splint is well padded with webril and is in turn held in place with Kerlix and Ace bandage. Meanwhile the patient is awakened and extubated in the operating room and returned to the recovery room in good condition. Sponge and needle counts reported as correct at the end of the procedure."
Orthopedic," HISTORY: We had the pleasure of seeing the patient today in our Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic. He was sent here with a chief complaint of joint pain in several joints for few months. This is a 7-year-old white male who has no history of systemic disease, who until 2 months ago, was doing well and 2 months ago, he started to complain of pain in his fingers, elbows, and neck. At this moment, this is better and is almost gone, but for several months, he was having pain to the point that he would cry at some point. He is not a complainer according to his mom and he is a very active kid. There is no history of previous illness to this or had gastrointestinal problems. He has problems with allergies, especially seasonal allergies and he takes Claritin for it. Other than that, he has not had any other problem. Denies any swelling except for that doctor mentioned swelling on his elbow. There is no history of rash, no stomach pain, no diarrhea, no fevers, no weight loss, no ulcers in his mouth except for canker sores. No lymphadenopathy, no eye problems, and no urinary problems. MEDICATIONS: His medications consist only of Motrin only as needed and Claritin currently for seasonal allergies and rhinitis. ALLERGIES: He has no allergies to any drugs. BIRTH HISTORY: Pregnancy and delivery with no complications. He has no history of hospitalizations or surgeries. FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for arthritis in his grandmother. No history of pediatric arthritis. There is history of psoriasis in his dad. SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives with mom, dad, brother, sister, and everybody is healthy. They live in Easton. They have 4 dogs, 3 cats, 3 mules and no deer. At school, he is in second grade and he is doing PE without any limitation. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature is 98.7, pulse is 96, respiratory rate is 24, height is 118.1 cm, weight is 22.1 kg, and blood pressure is 61/44. GENERAL: He is alert, active, in no distress, very cooperative. HEENT: He has no facial rash. No lymphadenopathy. Oral mucosa is clear. No tonsillitis. His ear canals are clear and pupils are reactive to light and accommodation. CHEST: Clear to auscultation. HEART: Regular rhythm and no murmur. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender with no visceromegaly.

LABORATORY DATA: Includes an arthritis panel. It has normal uric acid, sedimentation rate of 2, rheumatoid factor of 6, and antinuclear antibody that is negative and C-reactive protein that is 7.1. His mother stated that this was done while he was having symptoms. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This patient may have had reactive arthritis. He is seen frequently and the patient has family history of psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis. I do not see any problems at this moment on his laboratories or on his physical examination. This may have been related to recent episode of viral infection or infection of some sort. Mother was oriented about the finding and my recommendation is to observe him and if there is any recurrence of the symptoms or persistence of swelling or limitation in any of his joints, I will be glad to see him back. If you have any question on further assessment and plan, please do no hesitate to contact us."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left little finger extensor tendon laceration. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left little finger extensor tendon laceration. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Repair of left little extensor tendon. COMPLICATIONS: None. BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. ANESTHESIA: Bier block. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 14-year-old right-hand dominant male who cut the back of his left little finger and had a small cut to his extensor tendon. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operative room, laid supine, administered intervenous sedation with Bier block and prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The old laceration was opened and the extensor tendon was identified and there was a small longitudinal laceration in the tendon, which is essentially in line with the tendon fibers. This was just proximal to the PIP joint and on complete flexion of the PIP joint, I did separate just a little bit that was not thought to be significantly dynamically unstable. It was sutured with a single 4-0 Prolene interrupted figure-of-eight suture and on dynamic motion it did not separate at all. The wound was irrigated and closed with 5-0 nylon interrupted sutures. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the PCU in good condition."

PROCEDURES DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION: Right total hip arthroplasty and removal of hardware. CONSULTS: Acute pain team consult. DISPOSITION: Home. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND HOSPITAL COURSE: For details, please refer to clinic notes and OP notes. In brief, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a posttraumatic AV in the right femoral head. She came in consult with Dr. X who after reviewing the clinical and radiological findings recommended she undergo a right total hip arthroplasty and removal of old hardware. After being explained the risks, benefits, alternative options, and possible outcomes of surgery, she was agreeable and consented to proceed and therefore on the day of her admission, she was sent to the operating room where she underwent a right total hip arthroplasty and removal of hardware without any complications. She was then transferred to PACU for recovery and postop orthopedic floor for convalescence, physical therapy, and discharge planning. DVT prophylaxis was initiated with Lovenox. Postop pain was adequately managed with the aid of Acute Pain team. Postop acute blood loss anemia was treated with blood transfusions to an adequate level of hemoglobin. Physical therapy and occupational therapy were initiated and continued to work with her towards discharge clearance on the day of her discharge. DISPOSITION: Home. On the day of her discharge, she was afebrile, vital signs were stable. She was in no acute distress. Her right hip incision was clean, dry, and intact. Extremity was warm and well perfused. Compartments were soft. Capillary refill less than two seconds. Distal pulses were present. PREDISCHARGE LABORATORY FINDINGS: White count of 10.9, hemoglobin of 9.5, and BMP is pending. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: Continue diet as before. ACTIVITY: Weightbearing as tolerated in the right lower extremity as instructed. Do not lift, drive, move furniture, do strenuous activity for six weeks.

Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acetabular fracture on the left posterior column/transverse posterior wall variety with an accompanying displaced fracture of the intertrochanteric variety to the left hip. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acetabular fracture on the left posterior column/transverse posterior wall variety with an accompanying displaced fracture of the intertrochanteric variety to the left hip. PROCEDURES: 1. Osteosynthesis of acetabular fracture on the left, complex variety. 2. Total hip replacement. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient in the left side up lateral position under adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient's left lower extremity and buttock area were prepped with iodine and alcohol in the usual fashion, draped with sterile towels and drapes so as to create a sterile field. Kocher Langenbeck variety incision was utilized and carried down through the fascia lata with the split fibers of the gluteus maximus in line. The femoral insertion of gluteus maximus was tenotomized close to its femoral insertion. The piriformis and obturator internus tendons and adjacent gemelli were tenotomized close to their femoral insertion, tagged, and retractor was placed in the lesser notch as well as a malleable retractor in the greater notch enabling the exposure of the posterior column. The major transverse fracture was freed of infolded soft tissue, clotted blood, and lavaged copiously with sterile saline solution and then reduced anatomically with the aid of bone hook in the notch and provisionally stabilized utilizing a tenaculum clamp and definitively stabilized utilizing a 7-hole 3.5 mm reconstruction plate with the montage including two interfragmentary screws. It should be mentioned that prior to reduction and stabilization of the acetabular fracture its femoral head component was removed from the joint enabling direct visualization of the articular surface. Once a stable fixation of the reduced fracture of the acetabulum was accomplished, it should be mentioned that in the process of doing this, the posterior wall fragment was hinged on its soft tissue attachments and a capsulotomy was made in the capsule in line with the rent at the level of the posterior wall. Once this was accomplished, the procedure was turned over to Dr. X and his team, who proceeded with placement of cup and femoral components as well and cup was preceded by placement of a trabecular metal tray for the cup with screw fixation of same. This will be dictated in separate note. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The sciatic nerve was well protected and directly visualized to the level of the notch."

PROCEDURE: Left distal medial hamstring release. ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia. Local anesthetic 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine local. TOURNIQUET TIME: 15 minutes. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. COMPLICATIONS: There were no intraoperative complications. DRAIN: None. SPECIMENS: None. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 12-year-old boy born at a 32-week gestation and with drug exposure in utero. The patient has diagnosis of autism as well. The patient presented with bilateral knee flexion contractures, initially worse on right than left. He had right distal medial hamstring release performed in February 2007 and has done quite well and has noted significant improvement in his gait and his ability to play. The patient presents now with worsening left knee flexion contracture, and desires the same procedure to be performed. Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed. The risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of extremity, failure to restore normal anatomy, continued contracture, possible need for other procedures. All questions were answered and mother and son agreed to above plan. PROCEDURE NOTE: The patient was taken to operating room and placed supine on operating table. General anesthesia was administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. Nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh. The extremity was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion. The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg. Esmarch was then removed. A small 3 cm incision was made over the distal medial hamstring. Hamstring tendons were isolated and released in order of semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and sartorius. The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and closed used 2-0 Vicryl and then 4-0 Monocryl. The wound was cleaned and dried and dressed with Steri-Strips. The area was infiltrated with total 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine. The wound was then covered with Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and Bias. Tourniquet was released at 15 minutes. The patient was then placed in knee immobilizer. The patient tolerated the procedure well and subsequently taken to recovery in stable condition. POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: The patient may weight bear as tolerated in his brace. He will start physical therapy in another week or two. The patient restricted from any PE for at least 6 week. He may return to school on 01/04/2008. He was given Vicodin for pain."

Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right carpal tunnel syndrome. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right carpal tunnel syndrome. PROCEDURE: Right carpal tunnel release. ANESTHESIA: Bier block to the right hand. TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: 20 minutes. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: Stable to PACU. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 cc. GROSS OPERATIVE FINDINGS: We did find a compressed right median nerve upon entering the carpal tunnel, otherwise, the structures of the carpal canal are otherwise unremarkable. No evidence of tumor was found. BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 54-year-old female who was complaining of right hand numbness and tingling of the median distribution and has elected to undergo carpal tunnel surgery secondary to failure of conservative management. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operative room and placed in the supine position. The patient underwent a Bier block by the Department of Anesthesia on the upper extremity. The upper extremity was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion and left free. Attention was drawn then to the palm of the hand. We did identify area of incision that we would make, which was located over the carpal tunnel. Approximately, 1.5 cm incision was made using a #10 blade scalpel. Dissection was carried through the skin and fascia over the palm down to the carpal tunnel taking care during dissection to avoid any branches of nerves. Carpal tunnel was then entered and the rest of the transverse carpal ligament was incised sharply with a #10 scalpel. We inspected the median nerve and found that it was flat and compressed from the transverse carpal ligament. We found no evidence of tumor or space occupying lesion in the carpal tunnel. We then irrigated copiously. Tourniquet was taken down at that time and pressure was held. There was no evidence of obvious bleeders. We approximated the skin with nylon and placed a postoperative dressing with a volar splint. The patient tolerated the procedure well. She was placed back in the gurney and taken to PACU."

Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right trigger thumb. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right trigger thumb. SURGERY: Release of A1 pulley, CPT code 26055. ANESTHESIA: General LMA. TOURNIQUET TIME: 9 minutes at 200 torr. FINDINGS: The patient was found to have limitations to extension at the IP joint to the right thumb. He was found to have full extension after release of A1 pulley. INDICATIONS: The patient is 2-1/2-year-old. He has a history of a trigger thumb. This was evaluated in the office. He was indicated for release of A1 pulley to allow for full excursion. Risks and benefits including recurrence, infection, and problems with anesthesia were discussed at length with the family. They wanted to proceed. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought into the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position. General anesthesia was induced without incident. He was given a weight-adjusted dose of antibiotics. The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in a standard fashion. Limb was exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage. Tourniquet was raised to 200 torr. Transverse incision was then made at the base of thumb. The underlying soft tissues were carefully spread in line longitudinally. The underlying tendon was then identified. The accompanied A1 pulley was also identified. This was incised longitudinally using #11 blade. Inspection of the entire tendon then demonstrated good motion both in flexion and extension. The leaflets of the pulley were easily identified. The wound was then irrigated and closed. The skin was closed using interrupted #4-0 Monocryl simple sutures. The area was injected with 5 mL of 0.25% Marcaine. The wound was dressed with Xeroform, dry sterile dressings, hand dressing, Kerlix, and Coban. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in good condition. There were no complications. All instrument, sponge, needle counts were correct at the end of case. PLAN: The patient will be discharged home. He will return in 1-1/2 weeks for wound inspection."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Closed type-III supracondylar fracture, left distal humerus. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Closed type-III supracondylar fracture, left distal humerus. 2. Tethered brachial artery, left elbow. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Closed reduction percutaneous pinning, left distal humerus. SPECIFICATIONS: The entire operative procedure was done in the inpatient operating suite, room #2 at ABCD General Hospital. A portion of the procedure was done in consult with Dr. X with separate dictation by him. HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: This is a 4-year-old white male, apparently dominantly right-handed who suffered a severe injury to his left distal humerus after jumping off of a swing. He apparently had not had previous problems with his left arm. He was seen in the Emergency with a grossly deformed left elbow. His parents' were both present preoperatively. His x-ray exam as well as physical exam was consistent with a closed type-III supracondylar fracture of the left distal humerus with rather severe puckering of the skin anteriorly with significant ecchymosis in the same region. Gross neurologic exam revealed his ulnar, median, and radial nerves to be mostly intact, although a complete exam was impossible. He did have a radial pulse palpable. PROCEDURE: After discussing the alternatives of the case as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations with the patient's parents including malunion, nonunion, gross deformity, growth arrest, infection, loss of elbow motions, stiffness, instability, need for surgery in the future, nerve problems, artery problems, and compartment syndrome, they elected to proceed. The patient was laid supine upon operative table after receiving general anesthetic by Anesthesia Department. Closed reduction was accomplished in a sequential manner. Milking of the soft tissue envelope was carried out to try and reduce the shaft of the humerus back into its plane relative to the brachialis muscle and the neurovascular bundle anteriorly. Then a slow longitudinal traction was carried out. The elbow was hyperflexed. Pressure placed upon the olecranon tip and two 0.045 K-wires placed first, one being on the lateral side and with this placement on the medial side of medial epicondyle with care taken to protect the ulnar nerve. The close reduction was deemed to be acceptable once viewed on C-arm. After this, pulse was attempted to be palpated distally. Prior to the procedure, I talked to Dr. X of Vascular Surgery at ABCD Hospital. He had scrubbed in to the case to follow up on the loss of the radial artery distally. This was not present palpatory, but also by Doppler. A weak ulnar artery pulse was present via Doppler. Because of this, the severe displacement of the injury and the fact that the Doppler sound had an occlusion-type sound just above the fracture site or _______. A long discussion was carried out with Dr. X and myself, and we decided to proceed with exploration of the brachial artery. Prior to this, I went out to the waiting room to discuss with the patient's parents, the reasoning what we are going to do and the reasoning for this. I then came back in and then we proceeded. He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Please see Dr. X's report for the discussion of the exploration and release of the brachial artery. There was no indication that it was actually in the fracture site, the soft tissue had tethered in its right angle towards the fracture site, thus reducing its efficiency of providing blood distally. Once it was released, both clinically on the table as well as by Doppler, the patient had bounding pulses. We then proceeded to close utilizing a #4-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous fat closure and a running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch for skin closure. Steri-Strips were placed. The patient's arm was placed in just a slight degree of flexion with a neutral position. He was splinted posteriorly. Adaptic and fluffs have been placed around the patient's pin sites. K-wires have been bent, cut, and pin caps placed. Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is guarded for the obvious reasons noted above. There is concern for growth plate disturbance. He will be watched very closely for the potential development of re-perfusing compartment syndrome. A full and complete neurologic exam will be impossible tonight, but will be carried on a sequential basis starting tomorrow morning. There is always a potential for loss of elbow motion, overall cosmetic elbow alignment, and elbow function."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Dorsal ganglion, right wrist. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Dorsal ganglion, right wrist. OPERATIONS PERFORMED: Excision dorsal ganglion, right wrist. ANESTHESIA: Monitored anesthesia care with regional anesthesia applied by surgeon. TOURNIQUET TIME: minutes. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: With the patient under adequate anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner. The arm was exsanguinated and the tourniquet was elevated to 290 mm/Hg. A transverse incision was made over the dorsal ganglion. Using blunt dissection the dorsal ulnar sensory nerve branches and radial sensory nerve branches were dissected and retracted out of the operative field. The extensor retinaculum was then incised and the extensor tendon was dissected and retracted out of the operative field. The ganglion was then further dissected to its origin from the dorsal distal scapholunate interosseus ligament and excised in toto. Care was taken to protect ligament integrity. Reactive synovium was then removed using soft tissue rongeur technique. The wound was then infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine. The tendons were allowed to resume their normal anatomical position. The skin was closed with 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch. Sterile dressings were applied. The tourniquet was deflated. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Patellar tendon retinaculum ruptures, right knee. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Patellar tendon retinaculum ruptures, right knee. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Patellar tendon and medial and lateral retinaculum repair, right knee. SPECIFICATIONS: Intraoperative procedure done at Inpatient Operative Suite, room #2 of ABCD Hospital. This was done under subarachnoid block anesthetic in supine position. HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: The patient is a 45-year-old African-American male who suffered acute rupture of his patellar tendon diagnosed both by exam as well as x-ray the evening before surgical intervention. He did this while playing basketball. He had a massive deficit at the inferior pole of his patella on exam. Once opened, he had complete rupture of this patellar tendon as well as a complete rupture of his medial lateral retinaculum. Minimal cartilaginous pieces were at the patellar tendon. He had grade II changes to his femoral sulcus as well as grade I-II changes to the undersurface of the patella. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was laid supine on the operative table receiving a subarachnoid block anesthetic by Anesthesia Department. A thigh high tourniquet was placed. He is prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Limb was elevated, exsanguinated and tourniquet placed at 325 mmHg for approximately 30 to 40 minutes. Straight incision is carried down through skin and subcutaneous tissue anteriorly. Hemostasis was controlled via electrocoagulation. Patellar tendon was isolated along with the patella itself. A 6 mm Dacron tape x2 was placed with a modified Kessler tendon stitch with a single limb both medially and laterally and a central limb with subsequent shared tape. The inferior pole was freshened up. Drill bit was utilized to make holes x3 longitudinally across the patella and the limbs strutted up through the patella with a suture passer. This was tied over the bony bridge superiorly. There was excellent reduction of the tendon to the patella. Interrupted running #1-Vicryl suture was utilized for over silk. A running #2-0 Vicryl for synovial closure medial and laterally as well as #1-Vicryl medial and lateral retinaculum. There was excellent repair. Copious irrigation was carried out. Tourniquet was dropped and hemostasis controlled via electrocoagulation. Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized for subcutaneous fat closure and skin staples were placed through the skin. Adaptic, 4 x 4s, ABDs, and sterile Webril were placed for compression dressing. Digits were warm and no brawny pulses present at the end of the case. The patient's leg was placed in a Don-Joy brace 0 to 20 degrees of flexion. He will leave this until seen in the office. Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Painful enlarged navicula, right foot. 2. Osteochondroma of right fifth metatarsal. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Painful enlarged navicula, right foot. 2. Osteochondroma of right fifth metatarsal. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Partial tarsectomy navicula, right foot. 2. Partial metatarsectomy, right foot. HISTORY: This 41-year-old Caucasian female who presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint. The patient states that she has extreme pain over the navicular bone with shoe gear as well as history of multiple osteochondromas of unknown origin. She states that she has been diagnosed with hereditary osteochondromas. She has had previous dissection of osteochondromas in the past and currently has not been diagnosed in her feet as well as spine and back. The patient desires surgical treatment at this time. PROCEDURE: An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area. The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap. Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff. After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 5 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in the diamond block type fashion around the navicular bone as well as the fifth metatarsal. Foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion. Foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg. The foot was lowered as well as the operating table. The sterile stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge. Attention was then directed to the navicular region on the right foot. The area was palpated until the bony prominence was noted. A curvilinear incision was made over the area of bony prominence. At that time, a total of 10 cc with addition of 1% additional lidocaine plain was injected into the surgical site. The incision was then deepened with #15 blade. All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis. The dissection was carried down to the level of the capsule and periosteum. A linear incision was made over the navicular bone obliquely from proximal dorsal to distal plantar over the navicular bone. The periosteum and the capsule were then reflected from the navicular bone at this time. A bony prominence was noted both medially and plantarly to the navicular bone. An osteotome and mallet were then used to resect the enlarged portion of the navicular bone. After resection with an osteotome there was noted to be a large plantar shelf. The surrounding soft tissues were then freed from this plantar area. Care was taken to protect the attachments of the posterior tibial tendon as much as possible. Only minimal resection of its attachment to the fiber was performed in order to expose the bone. Sagittal saw was then used to resect the remaining plantar medial prominent bone. The area was then smoothed with reciprocating rasp until no sharp edges were noted. The area was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline at which time there was noted to be a palpable ________ where the previous bony prominence had been noted. The area was then again flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl. The subcutaneous tissues were then reapproximated with #4-0 Vicryl to reduce tension from the incision and running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch was performed. Attention was then directed to the fifth metatarsal. There was noted to be a palpable bony prominence dorsally with fifth metatarsal head as well as radiographic evidence laterally of an osteochondroma at the neck of the fifth metatarsal. Approximately 7 cm incision was made dorsolaterally over the fifth metatarsal. The incision was then deepened with #15 blade. Care was taken to preserve the extensor tendon. The incision was then created over the capsule and periosteum of the fifth metatarsal head. Capsule and periosteum were reflected both dorsally, laterally, and plantarly. At that time, there was noted to be a visible osteochondroma on the plantar lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal neck as well as on the dorsal aspect of the head of the fifth metatarsal. A sagittal saw was used to resect both of these osteal prominences. All remaining sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp. The area was inspected for the remaining bony prominences and none was noted. The area was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. The capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl. Subcutaneous closure was then performed with #4-0 Vicryl in order to reduce tension around the incision line. Running #5-0 subcutaneous stitch was then performed. Steri-Strips were applied to both surgical sites. Dressings consisted of Adaptic, soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and the hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the right foot. The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications. The patient was transferred to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact. The patient was given postoperative pain prescription and instructed to be partially weightbearing with crutches as tolerated. The patient is to follow-up with Dr. X in his office as directed or sooner if any problems or questions arise."
Orthopedic," PROCEDURE: Trigger thumb release. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. A transverse incision was made over the MPJ crease of the thumb. Dissection was carried down to the flexor sheath with care taken to identify and protect the neurovascular bundles. The flexor sheath was opened under direct vision with a scalpel, and then a scissor was used to release the A1 pulley under direct vision on the radial side, from its proximal extent to its distal extent at the junction of the proximal and middle thirds of the proximal phalanx. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery. The flexor pollicis longus tendon was identified and atraumatically pulled to ensure that no triggering remained. The patient then actively moved the thumb and no triggering was noted. After irrigating out the wound with copious amounts of sterile saline, the skin was closed with 5-0 nylon simple interrupted sutures. The wound was dressed and the patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Fractured right fifth metatarsal. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Fractured right fifth metatarsal. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Open reduction and internal screw fixation right fifth metatarsal. 2. Application of short leg splint. ANESTHESIA: TIVA/local. HISTORY: This 32-year-old female presents to Preoperative Holding Area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for open reduction and internal fixation of a fractured right fifth metatarsal. The patient relates that approximately in mid-June that she was working as a machinist at Detroit Diesel and dropped a large set of tools on her right foot. She continued to walk on the foot and found nothing was wrong despite the pain. She was recently seen by Dr. X and was referred to Dr. Y for surgery. The risks versus benefits of the procedure had been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. Y. The consent is available on the chart for review. The urine beta was taken in the preoperative area and was negative. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position. A safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection. Copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied. After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to perform an infiltrative type block to the right fifth metatarsal area of the right foot. Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion. An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg. The foot was lowered in the operative field and a sterile stocking was reflected. Attention was directed to the right fifth metatarsal base. The Xi-scan and fluoroscopic unit was used to visualize the fractured fifth metatarsal. An avulsion fracture of the right fifth metatarsal base was visualized. The fracture was linear in nature from distal lateral to proximal medial. There appeared to be a pseudoarthrosis on the lateral view. A skin scrub was used to carefully mark out all the landmarks including the peroneus longus and brevis tendons in the fifth metatarsal and the sural nerve. A linear incision was created with a #10 blade. A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous tissue. All small veins traversing the subcutaneous tissue were ligated with electrocautery. Next, using combination of sharp and blunt dissection, the deep fascia was reached. Next a linear capsuloperiosteal incision was made down to the bone using a #15 blade. Next, using a periosteal elevator and a #15 blade, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were stripped from the bone. The fracture site was not clearly visualized due to bony callus. A #25 gauge needle was introduced into the fracture site under fluoroscopy. The fracture site was easily found. An osteotome was used to separate the pseudoarthrosis. A curette was used to remove the hypertrophic excessive pseudoarthrotic bone. Next, a small ball burr was used to resect the remaining hypertrophic bone. Next, a #1.0 drill bit was used to drill the subchondral bone on either side of the fracture site and a good healthy bleeding bone. Next, a bone clamp was applied and the fracture was reduced. Next, a threaded K-wire was thrown from the proximal base of the fifth metatarsal across the fracture site distally. A #4-0 mm Synthes partially threaded, cannulated 50 mm screw was thrown using standard AO technique from the proximal fifth metatarsal base down the shaft and the fracture site was fixated rigidly. All this was done under fluoroscopy. Next, the wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. The fracture site was found to have rigid compression. The hypertrophic bone on the lateral aspect of the metatarsal was reduced with a ball burr and the wound was again flushed. Next, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion. A few fibers of the peroneus brevis tendon that were stripped from the base of the proximal phalanx were reattached carefully with Vicryl. Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted suture technique. Next, the skin was closed with #5-0 Prolene in a horizontal mattress technique. A postoperative fluoroscopic x-ray was taken and the bony alignment was found to be intact and the screw placement had excellent appearance. A dressing consisting of Owen silk, 4x4s, fluff, and Kerlix were applied. A sterile stockinet was applied over the foot. Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied to pad all bony prominences. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all digits. Next, 4-inch, pre-moulded, well-padded posterior splint was applied. The capillary refill time of the digits was less than three seconds. The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications. After anesthesia was reversed, she was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot. She was given Vicodin 5/500 mg #30 1-2 p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n., pain, Naprosyn 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.c., Keflex 500 mg #30 one p.o. t.i.d., till gone. She was given standard postoperative instructions to be non-weightbearing and was dispensed with crutches. She will rest, ice, and elevate her right leg. She is to follow up in the clinic on 08/26/03 at 10:30 a.m.. She was given emergency contact numbers and will call or return if problems arise earlier."
Orthopedic," EXAM: Noncontrast CT scan of the lumbar spine REASON FOR EXAM: Left lower extremity muscle spasm. COMPARISONS: None. FINDINGS: Transaxial thin slice CT images of the lumbar spine were obtained with sagittal and coronal reconstructions on emergency basis, as requested. No abnormal paraspinal masses are identified. There are sclerotic changes with anterior effusion of the sacroiliac joints bilaterally. There is marked intervertebral disk space narrowing at the L5-S1 level with intervertebral disk vacuum phenomenon and advanced endplate degenerative changes. Posterior disk osteophyte complex is present, most marked in the left paracentral to lateral region extending into the lateral recess on the left. This most likely will affect the S1 nerve root on the left. There are posterior hypertrophic changes extending into the neural foramina bilaterally inferiorly. There is mild neural foraminal stenosis present. Small amount of extruded disk vacuum phenomenon is present on the left in the region of the exiting nerve root. There is facet sclerosis bilaterally. Mild lateral recess stenosis just on the right, there is prominent anterior spondylosis. At the L4-5 level, mild bilateral facet arthrosis is present. There is broad based posterior annular disk bulging or protrusion, which mildly effaces the anterior aspect of the thecal sac and extends into the inferior aspect of the neural foramina bilaterally. No moderate or high-grade central canal or neural foraminal stenosis is identified. At the L3-4 level anterior spondylosis is present. There are endplate degenerative changes with mild posterior annular disk bulging, but no evidence of moderate or high-grade central canal or neural foraminal stenosis.

Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Mass, left second toe. 2. Tumor. 3. Left hallux bone invasion of the distal phalanx. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Mass, left second toe. 2. Tumor. 3. Left hallux with bone invasion of the distal phalanx. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Excision of mass, left second toe. 2. Distal Syme's amputation, left hallux with excisional biopsy. HISTORY: This 47-year-old Caucasian male presents to ABCD General Hospital with a history of tissue mass on his left foot. The patient states that the mass has been present for approximately two weeks and has been rapidly growing in size. The patient also has history of shave biopsy in the past. The patient does state that he desires surgical excision at this time. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area. The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap. Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff. After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 6 cc mixed with 1% lidocaine plain with 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a digital block fashion at the base of the left hallux as well as the left second toe. The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion. The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage. Care was taken with the exsanguination to perform exsanguination below the level of the digits so as not to rupture the masses. The foot was lowered to the operating table. The stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge. A distal Syme's incision was planned over the distal aspect of the left hallux. The incision was performed with a #10 blade and deepened with #15 down to the level of bone. The dorsal skin flap was removed and dissected in toto off of the distal phalanx. There was noted to be in growth of the soft tissue mass into the dorsal cortex with erosion in the dorsal cortex and exposure of cortical bone at the distal phalanx. The tissue was sent to Pathology where Dr. Green stated that a frozen sample would be of less use for examining for cancer. Dr. Green did state that he felt that there was an adequate incomplete excision of the soft tissue for specimen. At this time, a sagittal saw was then used to resect all ends of bone of the distal phalanx. The area was inspected for any remaining suspicious tissues. Any suspicious tissue was removed. The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon with a combination of simple and vertical mattress sutures. Attention was then directed to the left second toe. There was noted to be a dorsolateral mass over the dorsal distal aspect of the left second toe. A linear incision was made just medial to the tissue mass. The mass was then dissected from the overlying skin and off of the underlying capsule. This tissue mass was hard, round, and pearly-gray in appearance. It does not invade into any other surrounding tissues. The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon. Dressings consisted of Owen silk soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and an Ace wrap. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot. The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications. The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact. The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Vicodin and instructed to follow up with Dr. Bonnani in his office as directed. The patient will be contacted immediately pending the results of pathology. Cultures obtained in the case were aerobic and anaerobic gram stain, Silver stain, and a CBC."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ganglion of the left wrist. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ganglion of the left wrist. OPERATION: Excision of ganglion. ANESTHESIA: General. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. OPERATION: After a successful anesthetic, the patient was positioned on the operating table. A tourniquet applied to the upper arm. The extremity was prepped in a usual manner for a surgical procedure and draped off. The superficial vessels were exsanguinated with an elastic wrap and the tourniquet was then inflated to the usual arm pressure. A curved incision was made over the presenting ganglion over the dorsal aspect of the wrist. By blunt and sharp dissection, it was dissected out from underneath the extensor tendons and the stalk appeared to arise from the distal radiocapitellar joint and the dorsal capsule was excised along with the ganglion and the specimen was removed and submitted. The small superficial vessels were electrocoagulated and instilled after closing the skin with 4-0 Prolene, into the area was approximately 6 to 7 mL of 0.25 Marcaine with epinephrine. A Jackson-Pratt drain was inserted and then after the tourniquet was released, it was kept deflated until at least 5 to 10 minutes had passed and then it was activated and then removed in the recovery room. The dressings applied to the hand were that of Xeroform, 4x4s, ABD, Kerlix, and elastic wrap over a volar fiberglass splint. The tourniquet was released. Circulation returned to the fingers. The patient then was allowed to awaken and left the operating room in good condition."
Orthopedic," PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified. The patient was placed in the operating room table in supine position and given general anesthetic. Ancef 1 g was given for infectious prophylaxis. Once the patient was under general anesthesia, the knee was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Once the knee was fully prepped and draped, then we made 2 standard portals medial and lateral. Through the lateral portal, the camera was placed. Through the medial portal, tools were placed. We proceeded to examine scarring of the patellofemoral joint. Then we probed the patellofemoral joint. A chondroplasty was performed using a shaver. Then we moved down to the lateral gutter. Some loose bodies were found using a shaver and dissection. We moved down the medial gutter. No plica was found. We moved into the medial joint; we found that the medial meniscus was intact. We moved to the lateral joint and found that the lateral meniscus was intact. Pictures were taken. We drained the knee and washed out the knee with copious amounts of sterile saline solution. The instruments were removed. The 2 portals were closed using 3-0 nylon suture. Xeroform, 4 x 4s, Kerlix x2, and TED stocking were placed. The patient was successfully extubated and brought to the recovery room in stable condition. I then spoke with the family going over the case, postoperative instructions, and followup care."
Orthopedic," RICE stands for the most important elements of treatment for many injuries---rest, ice, compression, and elevation. REST: Stop using the injured part as soon as you realize that an injury has taken place. Use crutches to avoid bearing weight on injuries of the foot, ankle, knee, or leg. Use splints for injuries of the hand, wrist, elbow, or arm. Continued exercise or activity could cause further injury, increased pain, or a delay in healing. ICE: Ice helps stop bleeding from injured blood vessels and capillaries. Sudden cold causes the small blood vessels to contract. This contraction decreases the amount of blood that can collect around the wound. The more blood that collects, the longer the healing time. Ice can be safely applied in many ways: * For injuries to small areas, such as a finger, toe, foot, or wrist, immerse the injured area for 15 to 35 minutes in a bucket of ice water. Use ice cubes to keep the water cold, adding more as the ice cubes dissolve. * For injuries to larger areas, use ice packs. Avoid placing the ice directly on the skin. Before applying the ice, place a towel, cloth, or one or two layers of an elasticized compression bandage on the skin to be iced. To make the ice pack, put ice chips or ice cubes in a plastic bag or wrap them in a thin towel. Place the ice pack over the cloth. The pack may sit directly on the injured part, or it may be wrapped in place. * Ice the injured area for about 30 minutes. * Remove the ice to allow the skin to warm for 15 minutes. * Reapply the ice. * Repeat the icing and warming cycles for 3 hours. Follow the instructions below for compression and elevation. If pain and swelling persist after 3 hours call our office. You may need to change the icing schedule after the first 3 hours. Regular ice treatment is often discontinued after 24 to 48 hours. At that point, heat is sometimes more comfortable. COMPRESSION: Compression decreases swelling by slowing bleeding and limiting the accumulation of blood and plasma near the injured site. Without compression, fluid from adjacent normal tissue seeps into the injured area. To apply compression safely to an injury: * Use an elasticized bandage (Ace bandage) for compression, if possible. If you do not have one available, any kind of cloth will suffice for a short time. * Wrap the injured part firmly, wrapping over the ice. Begin wrapping below the injury site and extend above the injury site. * Be careful not to compress the area so tightly that the blood supply is impaired. Signs of deprivation of the blood supply include pain, numbness, cramping, and blue or dusky nails. Remove the compression bandage immediately if any of theses symptoms appears. Leave the bandage off until all signs of impaired circulation disappear. Then rewrap the area--less tightly this time. ELEVATION: Elevating the injured part above the level of the heart is another way to decrease swelling and pain at the injury site. Elevate the iced, compressed area in whatever way is most convenient. Prop an injured leg on a solid object or pillows. Elevate an injured arm by lying down and placing pillows under the arm or on the chest with the arm folded across."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Herniated nucleus pulposus C2-C3. 2. Spinal stenosis C3-C4. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Herniated nucleus pulposus C2-C3. 2. Spinal stenosis C3-C4. PROCEDURES 1. Anterior cervical discectomy, C3-C4, C2-C3. 2. Anterior cervical fusion, C2-C3, C3-C4. 3. Removal of old instrumentation, C4-C5. 4. Fusion C3-C4 and C2-C3 with instrumentation using ABC plates. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was placed in the supine position. The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for anterior cervical discectomy. A high incision was made to allow access to C2-C3. Skin and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma were divided sharply exposing the carotid sheath which was retracted laterally and the trachea and esophagus were retracted medially. This exposed the vertebral bodies of C2-C3 and C4-C5 which was bridged by a plate. We placed in self-retaining retractors. With the tooth beneath the blades, the longus colli muscles were dissected away from the vertebral bodies of C2, C3, C4, and C5. After having done this, we used the all-purpose instrumentation to remove the instrumentation at C4-C5, we could see that fusion at C4-C5 was solid. We next proceeded with the discectomy at C2-C3 and C3-C4 with disc removal. In a similar fashion using a curette to clean up the disc space and the space was fairly widened, as well as drilling up the vertebral joints using high-speed cutting followed by diamond drill bit. It was obvious that the C3-C4 neural foramina were almost totally obliterated due to the osteophytosis and foraminal stenosis. With the operating microscope; however, we had good visualization of these nerve roots, and we were able to ___________ both at C2-C3 and C3-C4. We then placed the ABC 55-mm plate from C2 down to C4. These were secured with 16-mm titanium screws after excellent purchase. We took an x-ray which showed excellent position of the plate, the screws, and the graft themselves. The next step was to irrigate the wound copiously with saline and bacitracin solution and s Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the prevertebral space and brought out through a separate incision. The wound was closed with 2-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissues and Steri-Strips used to close the skin. Blood loss was about 50 mL. No complication of the surgery. Needle count, sponge count, cottonoid count was correct. The operating microscope was used for the entirety for both visualization and magnification and illumination which was quite superb. At the time of surgery, he had total collapse of the C2, C3, and C4 disc with osteophyte formation. At both levels, he has high-grade spinal stenosis at these levels, especially foramen stenosis causing the compression, neck pain, headaches, and arm and shoulder pain. He does have degenerative changes at C5-C6, C6-C7, C7-T1; however, they do not appear to be symptomatic, although x-rays show the disks to be partially collapsed at all levels with osteophyte formation beginning to form."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Metatarsus primus varus with bunion deformity, right foot. 2. Hallux abductovalgus with angulation deformity, right foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Metatarsus primus varus with bunion deformity, right foot. 2. Hallux abductovalgus with angulation deformity, right foot. PROCEDURES: 1. Distal metaphyseal osteotomy and bunionectomy with internal screw fixation, right foot. 2. Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity of proximal phalanx, right foot. ANESTHESIA: Local infiltrate with IV sedation. INDICATION FOR SURGERY: The patient has had a longstanding history of foot problems. The foot problem has been progressive in nature and has not been responsive to conservative treatment. The preoperative discussion with the patient included the alternative treatment options. The procedure was explained in detail and risk factors such as infection, swelling, scarred tissue; numbness, continued pain, recurrence, and postoperative management were explained in detail. The patient has been advised, although no guaranty for success could be given, most patients have improved function and less pain. All questions were thoroughly answered. The patient requested surgical repair since the problem has reached a point that interferes with her normal daily activities. The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate the pain and discomfort. DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in a supine position. No tourniquet was utilized. IV sedation was administered and during that time local anesthetic consisting of approximately 10 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site. The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Balanced anesthesia was obtained. PROCEDURE #1: Distal metaphyseal osteotomy with internal screw fixation with bunionectomy, right foot. A dorsal curvilinear incision medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon was made, extending from the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal to a point midway on the shaft of the proximal phalanx. Care was taken to identify and retract the vital structures and when necessary, vessels were ligated via electrocautery. Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and then down to the capsular and periosteal layer, which was visualized. A linear periosteal capsular incision was made in line with the skin incision. The capsular tissue and periosteal layer were underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments, and they refracted to expose the osseous surface. Inspection revealed increased first intermetatarsal angle and hypertrophic changes to the first metatarsal head. The head of the first metatarsal was dissected free from its attachment medially and dorsally, delivered dorsally and may be into the wound. Inspection revealed the first metatarsophalangeal joint surface appeared to be in satisfactory condition. The sesamoid was in satisfactory condition. An oscillating saw was utilized to resect the hypertrophic portion of the first metatarsal head to remove the normal and functional configuration. Care was taken to preserve the sagittal groove. The rough edges were then smoothed with a rasp. Attention was then focused on the medial mid portion of the first metatarsal head where a K-wire access guide was positioned to define the apex and direction of displacement for the capital fragment. The access guide was noted to be in good position. A horizontally placed, through-and-through osteotomy with the apex distal and the base proximal was completed. The short plantar arm was from the access guide to proximal plantar and the long dorsal arm was from the access guide to proximal dorsal. The capital fragment was distracted off the first metatarsal, moved laterally to decrease the intermetatarsal angle to create a more anatomical and functional position of the first metatarsal head. The capital fragment was impacted upon the metatarsal. Inspection revealed satisfactory reduction of the intermetatarsal angle and good alignment of the capital fragment. It was then fixated with 1 screw. A guide pin was directed from the dorsal aspect of the capital fragment to the plantar aspect of the shaft and first metatarsal in a distal dorsal to proximal plantar direction. The length was measured, __________ mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured in position. Compression and fixation were noted to be satisfactory. Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the operative site. Attention was then directed to the medial portion of the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal where an oscillating saw was used to resect the small portion of the bone that was created by shifting the capital fragment laterally. All rough edges were rasped smooth. Examination revealed there was still lateral deviation of the hallux. A second procedure, the reposition osteotomy of the proximal phalanx with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity was indicated. PROCEDURE #2: Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity, proximal phalanx, right hallux. The original skin incision was extended from the point just distal to the interphalangeal joint. All vital structures were identified and retracted. Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and down to the periosteal layer, which was underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments and reflected to expose the osseous surface. The focus of the deformity was noted to be more distal on the hallux. Utilizing an oscillating saw, a more distal, wedge-shaped transverse oblique osteotomy was made with the apex being proximal and lateral and the base medial distal was affected. The proximal phalanx was then placed in appropriate alignment and stabilized with a guide pin, which was then measured, __________ 14 mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured into position. Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the osteotomy site. The alignment and contour of the first way was now satisfactorily improved. The entire surgical wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline irrigation. The periosteal and capsular layer was closed with running sutures of #3-0 Vicryl. The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #4-0 Vicryl and the skin edges coapted well with #4-0 nylon with running simples, reinforced with Steri-Strips. Approximately 6 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site for postoperative anesthesia. A dressing consisting of Adaptic and 4 x 4 was applied to the wound making sure the hallux was carefully splinted, followed by confirming bandages and an ACE wrap to provide mild compression. The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and left the operating room to recovery room in good postoperative condition with vital signs stable and arterial perfusion intact as evident by the normal capillary fill time. A walker boot was dispensed and applied. The patient should wear it when walking or standing. The next office visit will be in 4 days. The patient was given prescriptions for Percocet 5 mg #40 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain, along with written and oral home instructions. The patient was discharged home with vital signs stable in no acute distress."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severely comminuted fracture of the distal radius, left. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severely comminuted fracture of the distal radius, left. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: Open reduction and internal fixation, high grade Frykman VIII distal radius fracture. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. PREOPERATIVE INDICATIONS: This is a 52-year-old patient of mine who I have repaired both shoulder rotator cuffs, the most recent one in the calendar year 2007. While he was climbing a ladder recently in the immediate postop stage, he fell suffering the aforementioned heavily comminuted Frykman fracture. This fracture had a fragment that extended in the distal radial ulnar joint, a die-punch fragment in the center of the radius. The ulnar styloid and the radial styloid were off and there were severe dorsal comminutions. He presented to my office the morning of April 3, 2007, having had a left reduction done elsewhere a day ago. The reduction, although adequate, had allowed for the fragments to settle and I discussed with him the severity of the injury on a scale of 1-8, this was essentially an 8. The best results have been either with external fixation or internal fixation, most recently volar plating of a locking variety has been popular, and I felt that this would be appropriate in his case. Risks and benefits otherwise described were bleeding, infection, need to do operative revise or removal of hardware. He is taking a job out of state in the next couple of months. Hence I felt that even with close followup, this is a particularly difficult fracture as far as the morbidity of the injury proceeds. OPERATIVE NOTE: After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, one gram of Ancef was given intravenously. The left upper extremity was prepped and draped in supine position with the left hand in the arm table, magnification was used throughout. The time out procedure was done to the satisfaction of all present that this was indeed the appropriate extremity on the appropriate patient. A small C-arm was brought in to help guide the incision which was a volar curvilinear incision that included as part of this due to the fracture blisters eminent compartment syndrome and numbness in fingers. A carpal tunnel release was done with the transverse carpal ligament being protected with a Freer elevator. The usual amount of dissection of the pronator quadratus was necessary to view the distal radial fragment. The pronator quadratus actually grasped several of the fragments itself which had to be dissected free from them, specifically the distal radial ulnar joint and die-punch fragment. At this point, a locking Synthes distal radius plate from the modular handset was selected that had five articular screws as well as five locking shaft screws. The ulnar styloid was not affixed in any portion of this repair. The plate was viewed under the image intensification device, i.e., x-ray and the screws were placed in this order. The most proximal shaft screw was placed to allow the remainder of the plate to form a buttress to then rearrange the fragments around the locking screws and a locking plate having been selected from the volar approach, a locking 12-mm screw through 16-mm screws were placed in the following order. Most proximal on the radial shaft of the plate, then the radial styloid, i.e., the most distal and lateral screw, the next most proximal shaft screw followed by the distal radial ulnar joint screw. Three screws were locking across the die-punch fragment. The remaining two screws were placed into the radial shaft. All of these were locking screws of 2 mm in diameter and as the construct was created, the relative motion of the intra-articular fragment in dorsal comminution all diminished greatly, although the exposure as well as the amount of reduction force used was substantial. The tourniquet time was 1.5 hours. At this point, the tourniquet was let down. The entire construct was irrigated with copious amounts of bacitracin and normal saline. Closure was affected with 0 Vicryl underneath the skin surface followed by 3-0 Prolene in interrupted sutures in the volar wound. Several image intensification x-rays were taken at the conclusion of the case to check screw length. Screw lengths were changed out during the case as needed based on the x-ray findings. The wound was injected with Marcaine, lidocaine, Depo-Medrol, and Kantrex. A very heavily padded fluffy cotton Jones-type dressing was applied with a volar splint. Estimated blood loss was 10 mL. There were no specimens. Tourniquet time was 1.5 hours."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right hallux abductovalgus deformity. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right hallux abductovalgus deformity. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Right McBride bunionectomy. 2. Right basilar wedge osteotomy with OrthoPro screw fixation. ANESTHESIA: Local with IV sedation. HEMOSTASIS: With pneumatic ankle cuff. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in a supine position. The right foot was prepared and draped in usual sterile manner. Anesthesia was achieved utilizing a 50:50 mixture of 2% lidocaine plain with 0.5 Marcaine plain infiltrated just proximal to the first metatarsocuneiform joint. Hemostasis was achieved utilizing a pneumatic ankle Tourniquet placed above the right ankle and inflated to a pressure of 225 mmHg. At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right first metatarsophalangeal joint where dorsal linear incision approximately 3 cm in length was made. The incision was deepened within the same plain taking care of the Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary. The incision was then carried down to the underlying capsular structure once again taking care of the Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary. The capsular incision following the same outline as the skin incision was made and carried down to the underlying bony structure. The capsule was then freed from the underling bony structure utilizing sharp and blunt dissection. Using a microsagittal saw, the medial and dorsal very prominent bony eminence were removed and the area was inspected for any remaining bony prominences following resection of bone and those noted were removed using a hand rasp. At this time, attention was directed to the first inner space using sharp and blunt dissection. Dissection was carried down to the underling level of the adductor hallucis tendon, which was isolated and freed from its phalangeal, sesamoidal, and metatarsal attachments. The tendon was noted to lap the length and integrity for transfer and at this time was tenotomized taking out resection of approximately 0.5 cm to help prevent any re-fibrous attachment. At this time, the lateral release was stressed and was found to be complete. The extensor hallucis brevis tendon was then isolated using blunt dissection and was tenotomized as well taking out approximately 0.5-cm resection. The entire area was copiously flushed 3 times using a sterile saline solution and was inspected for any bony prominences remaining and it was noted that the base of the proximal phalanx on the medial side due to the removal of the extensive buildup of the metatarsal head was going to be very prominent in nature and at this time was removed using a microsagittal saw. The area was again copiously flushed and inspected for any abnormalities and/or prominences and none were noted. At this time, attention was directed to the base of the first metatarsal where a second incision was made approximately 4 cm in length. The incision was deepened within the same plain taking care of Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary. The incision was then carried down to the level of the metatarsal and using sharp and blunt dissection periosteal capsule structures were freed from the base of the metatarsal and taking care to retract the long extensive tendon and any neurovascular structures to avoid any disruption. At this time, there was a measurement made of 1 cm just distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint on the medial side and 2 cm distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint from the lateral aspect of the joint. At this time, 0.5 cm was measured distal to that lateral measurement and using microsagittal saw, a wedge osteotomy was taken from the base with the apex of the osteotomy being medial, taking care to keep the medial cortex intact as a hinge. The osteotomy site was feathered down until the osteotomy site could be closed with little tension on it and at this time using an OrthoPro screw 3.0 x 22 mm. The screw was placed following proper technique. The osteotomy site was found to be fixated with absolutely no movement and good stability upon manual testing. A very tiny gap on the lateral aspect of the osteotomy site was found and this was filled in packing it with the cancellous bone that was left over from the wedge osteotomy. The packing of the cancellous bone was held in place with bone wax. The entire area was copiously flushed 3 times using a sterile saline solution and was inspected and tested again for any movement of the osteotomy site or any gapping and then removed. At this time, a deep closure was achieved utilizing #2-0 Vicryl suture, subcuticular closure was achieved using #4-0 Vicryl suture, and skin repair was achieved at both surgical sites with #5-0 nylon suture in a running interlocking fashion. The hallux was found to have excellent movement upon completion of the osteotomy and the second procedure of the McBride bunionectomy and the metatarsal was found to stay in excellent alignment with good stability at the proximal osteotomy site. At this time, the surgical site was postoperatively injected with 0.5 Marcaine plain as well as dexamethasone 4 mg primarily. The surgical sites were then dressed with sterile Xeroform, sterile 4x4s, cascading, and Kling with a final protective layer of fiberglass in a nonweightbearing cast fashion. The tourniquet was dropped and color and temperature of all digits returned to normal. The patient tolerated the anesthesia and the procedure well and left the operating room in stable condition. The patient has been given written and verbal postoperative instructions and has been instructed to call if she has any questions, problems, or concerns at any time with the numbers provided. The patient has also been warned a number of times the importance of elevation and no weightbearing on the surgical foot."
Orthopedic," FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Herniated nucleuses pulposus, C5-6 greater than C6-7, left greater than C4-5 right with left radiculopathy. 2. Moderate stenosis C5-6. OPERATION: On 06/25/07, anterior cervical discectomy and fusions C4-5, C5-6, C6-7 using Bengal cages and Slimlock plate C4 to C7; intraoperative x-ray. This is a 60-year-old white male who was in the office on 05/01/07 because of neck pain with left radiculopathy and &quot;tension headaches.&quot; In the last year or so, he has had more and more difficulty and more recently has developed tingling and numbness into the fingers of the left hand greater than right. He has some neck pain at times and has seen Dr. X for an epidural steroid injection, which was very helpful. More recently he saw Dr. Y and went through some physical therapy without much relief. Cervical MRI scan was obtained and revealed a large right-sided disc herniation at C4-5 with significant midline herniations at C5-6 and a large left HNP at C6-7. In view of the multiple levels of pathology, I was not confident that anything short of surgical intervention would give him significant relief. The procedure and its risk were fully discussed and he decided to proceed with the operation. HOSPITAL COURSE: Following admission, the procedure was carried out without difficulty. Blood loss was about 125 cc. Postop x-ray showed good alignment and positioning of the cages, plate, and screws. After surgery, he was able to slowly increase his activity level with assistance from physical therapy. He had some muscle spasm and soreness between the shoulder blades and into the back part of his neck. He also had some nausea with the PCA. He had a low-grade fever to 100.2 and was started on incentive spirometry. Over the next 12 hours, his fever resolved and he was able to start getting up and around much more easily. By 06/27/07, he was ready to go home. He has been counseled regarding wound care and has received a neck sheet for instruction. He will be seen in two weeks for wound check and for a followup evaluation/x-rays in about six weeks. He has prescriptions for Lortab 7.5 mg and Robaxin 750 mg. He is to call if there are any problems."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Spondylosis with cervical stenosis C5-C6 greater than C4-C5, C6-C7, (721.0, 723.0). 2. Neck pain with left radiculopathy, progressive (723.1/723.4). 3. Headaches, progressive (784.0). POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Spondylosis with cervical stenosis C5-C6 greater than C4-C5, C6-C7, (721.0, 723.0). 2. Neck pain with left radiculopathy, progressive (723.1/723.4). 3. Headaches, progressive (784.0). PROCEDURES: 1. Anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 for neural decompression (63075). 2. Anterior interbody fusion C5-C6 (22554) utilizing Bengal cage (22851). 3. Anterior cervical instrumentation at C5-C6 for stabilization by Uniplate construction at C5-C6 (22845); with intraoperative x-ray x2. SERVICE: Neurosurgery ANESTHESIA: General. OPERATION: The patient was brought into the operating room, placed in supine position where general anesthesia was administered. Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion. A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leaning edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected with only blunt dissection. With only blunt dissection, the prevertebral space was encountered and longus colli muscle was cauterized along the mesial border and self-retaining retractors were placed to protect surrounding tissues throughout the remainder of the case. An intraoperative x-ray confirmed the interspace at C5-C6, C4-C5, and C6-C7 with prominent anterior osteophytes removed at C5-C6 noting particular disc collapse and far worsening spondylosis at C5-C6 than anywhere else in the neck. The annulus was cauterized and sharply excised and a discectomy followed with removing degenerated fragments of discs, which were sent to Pathology for permanent section in a routine fashion with straight disc forceps as needed, with residual discs drilled away as drilling extended from normal cortical cancellous elements with rather osteoporotic vertebral bodies noted. Prominent osteophytes were removed on the right side far more prominently on the left side with the worst compression on the nerve roots on the left, and all these were decompressed widely laterally bilaterally to completely decompress the dura, and the ligament as well, performed with a 1 and 2 mm micro Kerrison rongeur as necessary. The dura bulged into the interspace, a sign of a decompressed status finally and the entire area was inspected and at no time during the case there was evidence of CSF leakage of any type. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution and an appropriate size Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements and countersunk into position and was quite tightly applied. Further stability was added regardless with an appropriate size Uniplate with appropriate size screws and a post placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements and satisfactory postioning. After further inspection, the wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution again and closed in a routine fashion with approximation of the platysma with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and the skin with a subcuticular stitch of #4-0 Vicryl reinforced with Steri-Strips. A Penrose drain was carried from the prevertebral space externally with the skin wound and safety pin for security and incorporated later into a sterile bandage in a routine fashion. The patient was then taking from the operative room and extubated to the recovery area having left in stable condition. At the conclusion of the case, all instruments, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct and there were no intraoperative complications of any type."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Comminuted fracture, dislocation left proximal humerus. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Comminuted fracture, dislocation left proximal humerus. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Hemiarthroplasty of left shoulder utilizing a global advantage system with an #8 mm cemented humeral stem and 48 x 21 mm modular head replacement. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to OR #2, administered general anesthetic. He was positioned in the modified beach chair position on the operative table utilizing the shoulder apparatus. The left shoulder and upper extremities were then prepped and draped in the usual manner. A longitudinal incision was made extending from a point just lateral to the coracoid down towards deltoid tuberosity of the humerus. This incision was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissues were split utilizing the coag cautery. Hemostasis was achieved with the cautery. The deltoid fascia were identified, skin flaps were then created. The deltopectoral interval was identified and the deltoid split just lateral to the cephalic vein. The deltoid was then retracted. There was marked hematoma and swelling within the subdeltoid bursa. This area was removed with rongeurs. The biceps tendon was identified which was the landmark for the rotator interval. Mayo scissors was utilized to split the remaining portion of the rotator interval. The greater tuberosity portion with the rotator cuff was identified. Excess bone was removed from the greater tuberosity side to allow for closure later. The lesser tuberosity portion with the subscapularis was still attached to the humeral head, therefore, osteotome was utilized to separate the lesser tuberosity from the humeral head fragment. Excess bone was removed from the lesser tuberosity as well. Both of these were tagged with Ethibond sutures for later. The humeral head was delivered out of the wound. It was localized to the area of the anteroinferior glenoid region. The glenoid was then inspected, and noted to be intact. The fracture was at the level of the surgical neck on the proximal humerus. The canal was repaired with the broaches. An #8 stem was chosen as it was going to be cemented into place. The trial stem was impacted into position and the shaft of the bone marked with the cautery to the appropriate retroversion. Trial reduction was performed. The 48 x 21 mm head was the most appropriate size, matching the patient's as well as the soft tissue tension on the shoulder. At this point, the wound was copiously irrigated with gentamycin solution. The canal was copiously irrigated as well and suctioned dry. Methyl methacrylate cement was mixed. The cement gun was filled and the canal was filled with the cement. The #8 stem was then impacted into place and held in the position in the appropriate retroversion until the cement had cured. Excess cement was removed by sharp dissection. Prior to cementation of the stem, a hole was drilled in the shaft of proximal humerus and #2 fiber wires were placed through this hole for closure later. Once the cement was cured, the modular head was impacted on to the Morse taper. It was stable and the shoulder was reduced. The lesser tuberosity was then reapproximated back to the original site utilizing the #2 fiber wire suture that was placed in the humeral shaft as well as the holes in the humeral implant. The greater tuberosity portion with rotator cuff was also attached to the implant as well as the shaft of the humerus utilizing #2 fiber wires as well. The rotator interval was closed with #2 fiber wire in an interrupted fashion. The biceps tendon was ________ within this closure. The wound was copiously irrigated with gentamycin solution, suctioned dry. The deltoid fascia was then approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl suture. Subcutaneous layer was approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and skin approximated with staples. Subcutaneous tissues were infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine solution. A bulky dressing was applied to the wound followed by application of a large arm sling. Circulatory status was intact in the extremity at the completion of the case. The patient was then transferred to recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition."

The patient was actually taken to the operating room, consent signed by durable power of attorney, taken on 08/06/2007, had right hip hemiarthroplasty, recovered without incidence. The patient had continued confusion and dementia, which is apparently his baseline secondary to his Alzheimer's. Brief elevation of white count following the surgery, which did subside. Studies, UA and blood culture were negative. The patient was stable and was discharged to Heartland. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: Transfer to ABC for rehab and continued care. Diabetic diet. Activity, ambulate as tolerated with posterior hip precautions. Rehab potential fair. He will need nursing, Social Work, PT/OT, and nutrition consults. Resume home meds, DVT prophylaxis, aspirin, and compression stockings. Follow up Dr. X in one to two weeks; call 123-4567 for an appointment."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Right cubital tunnel syndrome. 2. Right carpal tunnel syndrome. 3. Right olecranon bursitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Right cubital tunnel syndrome. 2. Right carpal tunnel syndrome. 3. Right olecranon bursitis. PROCEDURES: 1. Right ulnar nerve transposition. 2. Right carpal tunnel release. 3. Right excision of olecranon bursa. ANESTHESIA: General. BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. COMPLICATIONS: None. FINDINGS: Thickened transverse carpal ligament and partially subluxed ulnar nerve. SUMMARY: After informed consent was obtained and verified, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table. After uneventful general anesthesia was obtained, his right arm was sterilely prepped and draped in normal fashion. After elevation and exsanguination with an Esmarch, the tourniquet was inflated. The carpal tunnel was performed first with longitudinal incision in the palm carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The palmar fascia was divided exposing the transverse carpal ligament, which was incised longitudinally. A Freer was then inserted beneath the ligament, and dissection was carried out proximally and distally. After adequate release has been formed, the wound was irrigated and closed with nylon. The medial approach to the elbow was then performed and the skin was opened and subcutaneous tissues were dissected. A medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve was identified and protected throughout the case. The ulnar nerve was noted to be subluxing over the superior aspect of the medial epicondyle and flattened and inflamed. The ulnar nerve was freed proximally and distally. The medial intramuscular septum was excised and the flexor carpi ulnaris fascia was divided. The intraarticular branch and the first branch to the SCU were transected; and then the nerve was transposed, it did not appear to have any significant tension or sharp turns. The fascial sling was made from the medial epicondyle and sewn to the subcutaneous tissues and the nerve had good translation with flexion and extension of the elbow and not too tight. The wound was irrigated. The tourniquet was deflated and the wound had excellent hemostasis. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with #2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with staples. Prior to the tourniquet being deflated, the subcutaneous dissection was carried out over to the olecranon bursa, where the loose fragments were excised with a rongeurs as well as abrading the ulnar cortex and excision of hypertrophic bursa. A posterior splint was applied. Marcaine was injected into the incisions and the splint was reinforced with tape. He was awakened from the anesthesia and taken to recovery room in a stable condition. Final needle, instrument, and sponge counts were correct."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hallux abductovalgus deformity with bunion of the left foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hallux abductovalgus deformity with bunion of the left foot. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Scarf bunionectomy procedure of the first metatarsal of the left foot. ANESTHESIA: IV sedation with local. HISTORY: This patient is a 55-year-old female who presents to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for surgery for her painful left bunion. The patient has had increasing pain over time and is having difficulty ambulating and wearing shoes. The patient has failed to conservative treatment and desires surgical correction at this time. Risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained in detail by Dr. X, and consent is available on the chart for review. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After an IV established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was given preoperatively 600 mg of clindamycin intravenously. The patient was then taken to the Operating Suite via cart and was placed on the operating table in a supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for protection. Next, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over her left ankle with copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection. After adequate IV sedation was applied, the patient was given a local injection consisting of 17 cc of 4.5 cc 1% lidocaine plain, 4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain, and 1.0 cc of Solu-Medrol mixture in the standard Mayo block to the left foot. The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion. The foot was then elevated, the Esmarch was applied and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg. The foot was then lowered to the operating field. A sterile stockinet was reflected and the attention was directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot. After sufficient anesthesia, using a #10 blade a linear incision was made approximately 5 to 6 cm in length over the first metatarsophalangeal joint dorsally, just near to the extensor hallucis longus tendon. Then using a fresh #15 blade, this incision was deepened through the skin into the subcutaneous layer after all small traversing veins were ligated and cauterized with electrocautery. A neurovascular bundle was identified and reflected medially. Laterally the extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and protected with retraction as well. Care was then taken to undermine the medial and lateral margins of the first metatarsophalangeal joint carefully. The first metatarsophalangeal joint capsule was then identified and using a #15 blade, a linear incision made down to the bone through the joint capsule. The periosteum was reflected and elevated off of its bone and the metatarsal head as well as the base of the proximal phalanx to a small degree. Noted was a large hypertrophic bone spur on the dorsal medial aspect of the first metatarsal head as well as some small osteophytes along the medial portion of the proximal phalanx. Care was then taken to reflect and dissect the periosteum off of the shaft of the first metatarsal proximally into the proximal portion of the metatarsal close to the first metatarsocuneiform joint. The bone cortex was noted to be intact and in good condition. Following this, using a sagittal saw with a #138 blade, the attention was directed to the medial hypertrophic bone of the first metatarsal head. In the sagittal plane with the blade angulated from dorsolateral to proximal medial, the medial eminence of bone was resected. Plantarly it was noted that the tibial sesamoid groove was intact and the sesamoid apparatus was intact as well. Following this bone cut, 0.45 K-wire was inserted from medial to lateral through the medial portion of the first metatarsal head directed in the dorsal third of the metatarsal head. Then using the Reese osteotomy guide, the guide was directed from the distal portion of the metatarsal head proximally to the proximal portion of the first metatarsal. A second 0.45 K-wire was inserted proximally as well. Following this, using the sagittal saw with the #138 blade a transverse linear osteotomy cut was made through the first metatarsal from medial to lateral. After reaching the distal as well as the proximal portions of the bone and ensuring that cortex was cut on both the medial as well as lateral side, the Reese osteotomy guide was removed and the dorsal and plantar incision cuts were made. This began with the dorsal distal cut, which extended from medial to lateral with the dorsal portion of the blade angled proximally about five degrees through the dorsal third of the distal first metatarsal. Following this, attention was directed proximally and an incision osteotomy cut through the bone was made, directed medially to laterally with the inferior portion of the blade angled distally to transect the cortex of the bone. Following this, the distal portion of the osteotomy cut was freely movable and was able to be translocated medially. The head was then slit medially several millimeters until it was noted to be in good position and no chopping was present in the medullary canal of the bone. Following this, the bone was stabilized using a 0.45 K-wire distally as well as proximally directed from dorsal to planar direction. Next using the normal AO manner, the distal cortex was drilled from dorsal to plantar with a 2.0 mm drill bit and then over drilled proximally with the cortex using a 2.7 mm drill bit. The proximal cortex was then _________ and then the drill hole was measured and it was determined to be 18 mm in length from dorsal to plantar cortex. Then using 2.7 mm tap, the thread holes were placed and using an 18 x 2.7 mm screw ___________ was achieved and good apposition of the bone and tightness were achieved. Intramedullary sludge was noted to exit from the osteotomy cut. Following this, attention was directed proximally and the 0.45 K-wire was removed and the holes were predrilled using a 2.0 mm screw then over-drilled using 2.7 mm screw and counter sucked. Following this, the holes were measured, found to 20 mm in length and the drill hole was tapped using a 2.7 mm tap. Following this, a 20 mm full threaded screw was inserted and tightened. Good intramedullary sludge was noted and compression was achieved. Attention was then directed to the distal screw where it was once again tightened and found to be in good position with good bite. Following this, range of motion was performed on the first metatarsophalangeal joint and some lateral deviation of the hallux was noted. Based on this, a lateral release was performed. The extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and was transected medially and a linear incision was placed down using a #15 blade into the first interspace. The incision was then deepened with sharp and blunt dissection and using a curved hemostat, the transverse as well as the oblique fibers of the abductor hallucis tendon were identified and transected. Care was taken to perform lateral release around the fibular sesamoid through these suspensory ligaments as well as the transverse metatarsal ligament and the collateral ligament. Upon completion of this, the hallux was noted to be in a rectus position with good alignment. The area was then flushed and irrigated with copious amounts of sterile saline. After this, attention was directed back to the medial capsule and a medial capsulorrhaphy was performed and the capsule was closed using #3-0 Vicryl suture. Subcutaneous tissues were closed using #3-0 and #4-0 Vicryl sutures to close in layers. The skin was then reapproximated and closed using #5-0 Monocryl suture. Following this, the incisions were dressed and bandaged in the normal manner using Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, and Kerlix as well as Coban dressing. The tourniquet was then dropped with a total tourniquet time of 99 minutes at 250 mmHg. The patient followed the procedure and the anesthesia well and vascular status was intact as noted by immediate hyperemia to digits one through five of the left foot. The patient was then transferred back to the cart and escorted on the cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit. Following this, the patient was given prescription for Vicoprofen total #20 to be taken one every six hours as necessary for moderate to severe pain. The patient was also given prescription for clindamycin to be taken 300 mg four times a day. The patient was given surgical shoe and was placed in a posterior sling. The patient was given crutches and instructed to use them for ambulation. The patient was instructed to keep her foot iced and elevated and to remain nonweightbearing over the weekend. The patient will follow up with Dr. X on Tuesday morning at 11'o clock in his Livonia office. The patient was concerned about any possible allergic reaction to medication and was placed on codeine and antibiotics due to that. The patient has Dr. X's pager and will contact him over this weekend if she has any problems or complaints or return to Emergency Department if any difficulty should arise. X-rays were taken and the patient was discharged home upon completion of this."
Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Foraminal disc herniation of left L3-L4. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Foraminal disc herniation of left L3-L4. 2. Enlarged dorsal root ganglia of the left L3 nerve root. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Transpedicular decompression of the left L3-L4 with discectomy. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. SPECIMEN: None. HISTORY: This is a 55-year-old female with a four-month history of left thigh pain. An MRI of the lumbar spine has demonstrated a mass in the left L3 foramen displacing the nerve root, which appears to be a foraminal disc herniation effacing the L3 nerve root. Upon exploration of the nerve root, it appears that there was a small disc herniation in the foramen, but more impressive was the abnormal size of the dorsal root ganglia that was enlarged more medially than laterally. There was no erosion into the bone surrounding the area rather in the pedicle above or below or into the vertebral body, so otherwise the surrounding anatomy is normal. I was prepared to do a discectomy and had not consented the patient for a biopsy of the nerve root. But because of the sequela of cutting into a nerve root with residual weakness and persistent pain that the patient would suffer, at this point I was not able to perform this biopsy without prior consent from the patient. So, surgery ended decompressing the L3 foramen and providing a discectomy with idea that we will obtain contrasted MRIs in the near future and I will discuss the findings with the patient and make further recommendations. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to OR #5 at ABCD General Hospital in a gurney. Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic. Endotracheal intubation followed. The patient received the Foley catheter. She was then placed in a prone position on a Jackson table. Bony prominences were well padded. Localizing x-rays were obtained at this time and the back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A midline incision was made over the L3-L4 disc space taking through subcutaneous tissues sharply, dissection was then carried out to the left of the midline with lumbodorsal fascia incised and the musculature was elevated in a supraperiosteal fashion from the level of L3. Retractors were placed into the wound to retract the musculature. At this point, the pars interarticularis was identified and the facet joint of L2-L3 was identified. A marker was placed over the pedicle of L3 and confirmed radiographically. Next, a microscope was brought onto the field. The remainder of the procedure was noted with microscopic visualization. A high-speed drill was used to remove the small portions of the lateral aspects of the pars interarticularis. At this point, soft tissue was removed with a Kerrison rongeur and the nerve root was clearly identified in the foramen. As the disc space of L3-L4 is identified, there is a small prominence of the disc, but not as impressive as I would expect on the MRI. A discectomy was performed at this time removing only small portions of the lateral aspect of the disc. Next, the nerve root was clearly dissected out and visualized, the lateral aspect of the nerve root appears to be normal in structural appearance. The medial aspect with the axilla of the nerve root appears to be enlarged. The color of the tissue was consistent with a nerve root tissue. There was no identifiable plane and this is a gentle enlargement of the nerve root. There are no circumscribed lesions or masses that can easily be separated from the nerve root. As I described in the initial paragraph, since I was not prepared to perform a biopsy on the nerve and the patient had not been consented, I do not think it is reasonable to take the patient to this procedure, because she will have persistent weakness and pain in the leg following this procedure. So, at this point there is no further decompression. A nerve fork was passed both ventral and dorsal to the nerve root and there was no compression for lateral. The pedicle was palpated inferiorly and medially and there was no compression, as the nerve root can be easily moved medially. The wound was then irrigated copiously and suctioned dry. A concoction of Duramorph and ______ was then placed over the nerve root for pain control. The retractors were removed at this point. The fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissues with #2 Vicryl sutures, and Steri-Strips covering the incision. The patient transferred to the hospital gurney, extubated by Anesthesia, and subsequently transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition."
Orthopedic," CC: Right shoulder pain. HX: This 46 y/o RHF presented with a 4 month history of right neck and shoulder stiffness and pain. The symptoms progressively worsened over the 4 month course. 2 weeks prior to presentation she began to develop numbness in the first and second fingers of her right hand and RUE pain. The later was described as a throbbing pain. She also experienced numbness in both lower extremities and pain in the coccygeal region. The pains worsened at night and impaired sleep. She denied any visual change, bowel or bladder difficulties and symptoms involving the LUE. She occasionally experienced an electric shock like sensation shooting down her spine when flexing her neck (Lhermitte's phenomena). She denied any history of neck/back/head trauma. She had been taking Naprosyn with little relief. PMH: 1) Catamenial Headaches. 2) Allergy to Macrodantin. SHX/FHX: Smokes 2ppd cigarettes. EXAM: Vital signs were unremarkable. CN: unremarkable. Motor: full strength throughout. Normal tone and muscle bulk. Sensory: No deficits on LT/PP/VIB/TEMP/PROP testing. Coord/Gait/Station: Unremarkable. Reflexes: 2/2 in BUE except 2+ at left biceps. 1+/1+BLE except an absent right ankle reflex. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Rectal exam: normal tone. IMPRESSION: C-spine lesion. COURSE: MRI C-spine revealed a central C5-6 disk herniation with compression of the spinal cord at that level. EMG/NCV showed normal NCV, but 1+ sharps and fibrillations in the right biceps (C5-6), brachioradialis (C5-6), triceps (C7-8) and teres major; and 2+ sharps and fibrillations in the right pronator terres. There was increased insertional activity in all muscles tested on the right side. The findings were consistent with a C6-7 radiculopathy. The patient subsequently underwent C5-6 laminectomy and her symptoms resolved."
Orthopedic," TITLE OF OPERATION: Revision laminectomy L5-S1, discectomy L5-S1, right medial facetectomy, preparation of disk space and arthrodesis with interbody graft with BMP. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: Please refer to medical record, but in short, the patient is a 43-year-old male known to me, status post previous lumbar surgery for herniated disk with severe recurrence of axial back pain, failed conservative therapy. Risks and benefits of surgery were explained in detail including risk of bleeding, infection, stroke, heart attack, paralysis, need for further surgery, hardware failure, persistent symptoms, and death. This list was inclusive, but not exclusive. An informed consent was obtained after all patient's questions were answered. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe lumbar spondylosis L5-S1, collapsed disk space, hypermobility, and herniated disk posteriorly. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe lumbar spondylosis L5-S1, collapsed disk space, hypermobility, and herniated disk posteriorly. ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia and endotracheal tube intubation. DISPOSITION: The patient to PACU with stable vital signs. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room. After adequate general anesthesia with endotracheal tube intubation was obtained, the patient was placed prone on the Jackson table. Lumbar spine was shaved, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion. An incision was carried out from L4 to S1. Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar and Bovie cauterization. A Weitlaner was placed in the wound and a subperiosteal dissection was carried out identifying the lamina of L4, L5, and sacrum. At this time, laminectomy was carried out of L5-S1. Thecal sac was retracted rightward and the foramen was opened and unilateral medial facetectomy was carried out in the disk space. At this time, the disk was entered with a #15 blade and bipolar. The disk was entered with straight up and down-biting pituitaries, curettes, and the high speed drill and we were able to takedown calcified herniated disk. We were able to reestablish the disk space, it was very difficult, required meticulous dissection and then drilling with a diamond bur in the disk space underneath the spinal canal, very carefully holding the spinal canal out of harm's way as well as the exiting nerve root. Once this was done, we used rasps to remove more disk material anteriorly and under the midline to the left side and then we put in interbody graft of BMP 8 mm graft from Medtronic. At this time, Dr. X will dictate the posterolateral fusion, pedicle screw fixation to L4 to S1 with compression and will dictate the closure of the wound. There were no complications."
Orthopedic," REASON FOR EVALUATION: Evaluation for chronic pain program. COMPENSABLE INJURY: Left knee. CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left knee and low back pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. XYZ is an otherwise fairly healthy 44-year-old right-handed aircraft mechanic. On her date of injury, she reports that she was working on an aircraft when she fell between the airplane and a stand with about an 18-inch gap in between. She injured her left knee and underwent two arthroscopic procedures followed by patellar replacement and subsequently a left total knee arthroplasty in Month DD, YYYY. The patient is seen with no outside images, but an MRI report of the left knee and office notes from Dr. ABCD. The patient reports that she has undergone a full course of physical therapy and complains primarily of pain in the anterior aspect of the left knee and primarily over the medial and lateral tibial components with pain extending proximally to the distal femur and distally down into the anterior tibial plateau area. She has intermittent numbness and tingling in the posterolateral thigh and no symptoms at all into her feet. She has axial low back pain as an ancillary symptom. Her pain is worse with walking and is associated with swelling, popping and grinding. She complains of pins and needles sensation over the area of the common peroneal nerve overlying the fibular head. She has no dysesthetic or allodynic symptoms with light touch over the remainder of the knee and the femoral nerve area. Heavy pressure and light percussion of the fibular head produce painful numbness, tingling, and pins and needles sensation. The patient underwent a left knee MRI in September of 2006 revealing nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but no evidence of an acute fracture or a femoropatellar ligament avulsion or abnormality. She has continued to complain of persistent instability and pain. She is not working. She has a number of allergies to different pain medications and feels that her back has been bothersome mostly due to her gait disturbances relating to her knee. Her pain is described as constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, pulling, sharp, and stabbing in nature. It occasionally awakens her at night. It is better in recumbency with her leg elevated. Exacerbating factors include standing, walking, pushing, puling. VAS pain scale is rated as 6/10 for her average and current pain, 10/10 for worst pain, and 3/10 for her least pain. OSWESTRY PAIN INVENTORY: Significant impact on every aspect of her quality of life. The patient is not working and relates no particular functional goals. She does relate that she has put on quite a bit of weight since her injury. Apparently, Dr. ABCD has entertained the possibility of having of revising her tibial tray with a taller one. She has finished physical therapy and continues at home with quadriceps and hamstrings exercises. She has discontinued use of her knee brace. She would like to avoid surgery, if at all possible. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Otherwise, negative. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Otherwise, negative. MEDICATIONS: No medications. ALLERGIES: Phenergan, morphine, Flexeril, Keflex, Bactrim, general anesthetics, Benadryl, and pain meds. FAMILY HISTORY: Remarkable for cervical cancer, heart disease, COPD, dementia, diabetes, and CHF. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is not working. Rates her stress level as an 8/10. She is single with no children. Does not smoke, drink, or utilize illicit substances. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A thirteen-point review of systems was surveyed including constitutional, HEENT, cardiac, pulmonary, GI, GU, endocrine, integument, hematological, immunological, neurological, musculoskeletal, psychological and rheumatological. Review of systems is otherwise, negative. See as per HPI. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Weight 255 pounds, temp 97.6, pulse 74, BP 140/94. The patient walks with an antalgic gait to the left. She has pain vocalization with standing, walking, and range of motion of the knee. Head is normocephalic and atraumatic. Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Heart has regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops are appreciated. The abdomen is obese, though nontender, nondistended without palpable organomegaly or pulsatile masses. The skin is warm and dry to the touch with peripheral pulses equally palpable over the radial, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial areas. Neurological examination of the upper extremities is grossly intact to sensory and motor testing. Lower extremity neurologic exam reveals positive Tinel's features over the lateral aspect of the left fibular head. There is sensitivity over the distal aspect of her midline scar. No dystrophic features are evident. There is edema over the anterior tibial plateau and tenderness over both the medial, as well as lateral aspects of the tibial plateau. There is no discernible erythema over the knee. No discoloration. No trophic changes. She can extend almost to roughly about 10 and can flex to just at around 90 with pain behaviors. The patient is able to perform a straight leg lift and has otherwise normal engagement of all her distal musculature. Palpation of her axial skeleton reveals no bony step-off, skin tags, clefts or deformities. There is mild lumbar facetal features at the lumbosacral junction with extension and lateral bending. I can detect no clear pelvic asymmetry. IMPRESSION AND PLAN: Status post left knee injury with subsequent knee replacement and continued chronic painful left knee, mostly mechanical low back pain without evidence of radicular features. I think she may have a small sensory neuralgia of her left common peroneal nerve and has ongoing pain over her tibial plateau. The patient is not yet a year out from her surgery and understands that it may take several more months for her knee to settle down. There is no MR evidence of marrow edema or ligamentous disruption. She may have patellofemoral and/or tibial plateau related pain as well. She may do extremely well on a chronic pain program and is intolerant to most oral analgesics. She has worked since her date of injury and will need a graduated incremental return to her normal activities of daily living. Therefore, I have referred her for a chronic pain program through the Pain Care Center to be seen in followup upon completion."
Urology," REASON FOR ADMISSION: Penile injury and continuous bleeding from a penile laceration. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 18-year-old detainee who was brought by police officers because of a penile injury and bleeding. He is otherwise healthy. He tried to insert a marble in his penis four days ago. He told me that he grabbed the skin on the top of the penis and moved it away from the penis shaft and then using a toothbrush that he made in to a knife object he pierced the skin through from both sides and then kept moving the toothbrush to dilate and make a way for the marble. Then he inserted a heart-shaped marble in one of the puncture wounds and inserted it under the skin and kept it there. He was not significantly bleeding and essentially the bleeding stopped from both puncture wounds that he has. Then today four days after that procedure, he was taking a bath today and he thinks because of the weight he felt a gush in his pants and he looked and he saw the bleeding come out. He was bleeding so much that he started dripping to the sides of his legs. So, he was brought to the hospital. Actually after being seen by two nurses at the facility where he was at the detention center where he was at and they actually did the dressing twice and it was twice soaked with blood. He came here and was continuously bleeding from that area that we had to change the dressing twice and he is actually still bleeding especially from one of the laceration, the one on the right side of the penis. The marble also still can be felt underneath the skin. There is no urethral bleeding. He did urinate today without difficulty, without hematuria or dysuria. There is pain in the lacerations. No erythema in the skin or swelling in the penis and no other injuries. He did this procedure for sexual pleasure as he said. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Unremarkable. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Tonsillectomy. MEDICATION: He took only ibuprofen. No regular medication. ALLERGIES: None. SOCIAL HISTORY: He has been in detention for two months for immigration problems. No drugs. No alcohol. No smoking. He used to work in fast food chain. FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory to this illness. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Aside from the pain in the penis and continuous bleeding, he is basically asymptomatic and review of systems is unremarkable. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is a young Hispanic male, lying in bed, appear comfortable in no apparent distress. VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 97.8, heart rate 99, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 142/100, and saturation is 98% on room air. ENT: Sclerae nonicteric. Pupils reactive to light. Nostrils are normal. Oral cavity is clear. NECK: Supple. Trachea midline. No JVD. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. HEART: Normal S1 and S2. No murmurs or gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended. Positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Pulses strong bilaterally. No edema. GENITAL: Testicles appear normal. The penis shaft has two lacerations on both sides, one of them is bleeding. They measure about 5 to 6 mm on the right side, about 3 or 4 mm on the left side. The one on the right side is bleeding much more than the other one. There is a marble that can be felt and it is freely mobile underneath the skin of the dorsum of the penis. There is no bleeding from the meatus or discharge and no other injuries were seen by inspection. LABORATORY DATA: White count 11.1, hemoglobin 14.5, hematocrit 43.5, and platelets 303,000. Coags unremarkable. Glucose 106, creatinine 0.8, sodium 141, potassium 4, and calcium 9.7. Urinalysis unremarkable. IMPRESSION: The patient with a penile laceration that is continuously bleeding from inserting a marble four days ago, which is still underneath the skin of the shaft of the penis. No other injuries that can be seen and no other evidence of secondary bacterial infection at this time. The patient is currently refusing removal of the marble and insisting on just repairing the laceration and he is having discussion with Dr. X. PLAN: 1. The patient will be admitted to the hospital and will follow Dr. X's recommendation. 2. The patient was offered a repair of those lacerations, to stop the bleeding as well as the removal of the marble and he is currently considering that and discussing that with Dr. X. 3. Prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection. 4. He has mild hypertension, which is likely due to stress and pain and also the leukocytosis probably can be explained by that. This will be monitored. 5. Monitor H&H to determine if he needs any transfusion at this time. He does not need that. 6. IV fluid for hydration and volume resuscitation at this time. 7. Pain management. 8. Topical care for the wound VAC after repair. Time spent in evaluation and management of this patient including discussions about this procedure and the harm that can happen if he chooses to keep the penis including permanent damage and infection to the penis was 65 minutes. I had clearly explained to the patient in detail about the possibility of permanent penile damage that could affect erection and future sexual functioning as well as significant infection if a foreign object was retained in the penis under the skin and he verbalized understanding of this."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left inguinal hernia, direct. PROCEDURE: Left inguinal herniorrhaphy, modified Bassini. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was electively taken to the operating room. In same day surgery, Dr. X applied a magnet to the pacemaker defibrillator that the patient has to change it into a fixed mode and to protect the device from the action of the cautery. Informed consent was obtained, and the patient was transferred to the operating room where a time-out process was followed and the patient under general endotracheal anesthesia was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Local anesthesia was used as a field block and then an incision was made in the left inguinal area and carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis, which was opened. The cord was isolated and protected. It was dissected out. The lipoma of the cord was removed and the sac was high ligated. The main hernia was a direct hernia due to weakness of the floor. A Bassini repair was performed. We used a number of interrupted sutures of 2-0 Tevdek __________ in the conjoint tendon and the ilioinguinal ligament. The external oblique muscle was approximated same as the soft tissue with Vicryl and then the skin was closed with subcuticular suture of Monocryl. The dressing was applied and the patient tolerated the procedure well, estimated blood loss was minimal, was transferred to recovery room in satisfactory condition."
Urology," PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Bassini inguinal herniorrhaphy. ANESTHESIA: Local with MAC anesthesia. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table. The patient was sedated and an adequate local anesthetic was administered using 1% lidocaine without epinephrine. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A standard inguinal incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery. The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated. The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel and this incision was carried out to the external ring using Metzenbaum scissors. Care was taken not to injure the ilioinguinal nerve. Having exposed the inguinal canal, the cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a Penrose drain was then used to retract the cord structures as needed. Adherent cremasteric muscle was dissected free from the cord using Bovie electrocautery. The cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and the sac was found anteromedially to the cord structures. The sac was dissected free from the cord structures using a combination of blunt dissection and Bovie electrocautery. Once preperitoneal fat was encountered, the dissection stopped and the sac was suture ligated at the level of the preperitoneal fat using a 2-0 silk suture ligature. The sac was excised and sent to Pathology. The stump was examined and no bleeding was noted. The ends of the suture were then cut, and the stump retracted back into the abdomen. The floor of the inguinal canal was then strengthened by suturing the shelving edge of Poupart's ligament to the conjoined tendon using a 2-0 Prolene, starting at the pubic tubercle and running towards the internal ring. In this manner, an internal ring was created that admitted just the tip of my smallest finger. The Penrose drain was removed. The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery. The incision in the external oblique was approximated using a 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion, thus reforming the external ring. Marcaine 0.5% was injected 1 fingerbreadth anterior to the anterior and superior iliac spine and around the wound for postanesthetic pain control. The skin incision was approximated with skin staples. A dressing was then applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct. Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left communicating hydrocele. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left communicating hydrocele. ANESTHESIA: General. PROCEDURE: Left inguinal hernia and hydrocele repair. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 5-year-old young man with fluid collection in the tunica vaginalis and peritesticular space on the left side consistent with a communicating hydrocele. The fluid size tends to fluctuate with time but has been relatively persistent for the past year. I met with the patient's mom and also spoke with his father by phone in the past couple of months and explained the diagnosis of patent processus vaginalis for communicating hydrocele and talked to them about the surgical treatment and options. All their questions have been answered and the patient is fit for operation today. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient had a very thin patent processus vaginalis leading to a rather sizeable hydrocele sac in the left hemiscrotum. We probably drained around 10 to 15 mL of fluid from the hydrocele sac. The processus vaginalis was clearly seen back to the peritoneal reflection where a high ligation was successfully performed. There were no other abnormalities noted in the inguinal scrotal region. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of inhalation anesthetic. A peripheral IV was placed, and we conducted a surgical time-out to reiterate all of The patient's important identifying information and to confirm that we were indeed going to perform a left inguinal hernia and hydrocele repair. After preparation and draping was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution, a local infiltration block as well as an ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block was performed with 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine. A curvilinear incision was made low in the left inguinal area along one of prominent skin folds. Soft tissue dissection was carried down through Scarpa's layer to the external oblique fascia, which was then opened to expose the underlying spermatic cord structures. The processus vaginalis was dissected free from the spermatic cord structures, and the distal hydrocele sac was widely opened and drained of its fluid contents. The processus vaginalis was cleared back to peritoneal reflection at the deep inguinal ring and a high ligation was performed there using both the transfixing and a mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl. After the excess hydrocele and processus vaginalis tissue was excised, the spermatic cord structures were replaced and the external oblique and Scarpa's layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures. Subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used for the final skin closure. The patient tolerated the operation well. He was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition. Blood loss was minimal. No specimen was submitted."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Prostatism. 2. Bladder calculus. OPERATION: Holmium laser cystolithalopaxy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Prostatism. 2. Bladder calculus. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: This is a 62-year-old male diabetic and urinary retention with apparent neurogenic bladder and intermittent self-catheterization, recent urinary tract infections. The cystoscopy showed a large bladder calculus, short but obstructing prostate. He comes in now for transurethral resection of his prostate and holmium laser cystolithotripsy. He is a diabetic with obesity. LABORATORY DATA: Includes urinalysis showing white cells too much to count, 3-5 red cells, occasional bacteria. He had a serum creatinine of 1.2, sodium 138, potassium 4.6, glucose 190, calcium 9.1. Hematocrit 40.5, hemoglobin 13.8, white count 7,900. PROCEDURE: The patient was satisfactorily given general anesthesia. Prepped and draped in the dorsal lithotomy position. A 27-French Olympus rectoscope was passed via the urethra into the bladder. The bladder, prostate, and urethra were inspected. He had an obstructing prostate. He had marked catheter reaction in his bladder. He had a lot of villous changes, impossible to tell from frank tumor. He had a huge bladder calculus. It was white and round. I used the holmium laser with the largest fiber through the continuous flow resectoscope and sheath, and broke up the stone, breaking up approximately 40 grams of stone. There was still stone left at the end of the procedure. Most of the chips that could be irrigated out of the bladder were irrigated out using Ellik. Then the scope was removed and a 24-French 3-way Foley catheter was passed via the urethra into the bladder. The plan is to probably discharge the patient in the morning and then we will get a KUB. We will probably bring him back for a second stage cystolithotripsy, and ultimately do a TURP. We broke up the stone for over an hour, and my judgment continuing with litholapaxy transurethrally over an hour begins to markedly increase the risk to the patient."

Coagulation profile study had a PT of 15.9, PTT of 43 and INR of 1.3. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: The patient was given normal saline 2 liters over 1 hour without any adverse effect. The patient was given multiple doses of morphine to maintain his comfort while here in the emergency room without any adverse effect. The patient was given Levaquin 500 mg by mouth as well as 2 doses of Phenergan over the course of his stay here in the emergency department. The patient did not have an adverse reaction to these medicines either. Phenergan resolved his nausea and morphine did relieve his pain and make him pain free. I spoke with Dr. X, the patient's urologist, about most appropriate step for the patient, and Dr. X said he would be happy to care for the patient in the hospital and do urologic scopes if necessary and surgery if necessary and blood transfusion. It was all a matter of what the patient wished to do given the advanced stage of his cancer. Dr. X was willing to assist in any way the patient wished him to. I spoke with the patient and his son about what he would like to do and what the options were from doing nothing from keeping him comfortable with pain medicines to admitting him to the hospital with the possibility of scopes and even surgery being done as well as the blood transfusion. The patient decided to choose a middle ground in which he would be transfused with 2 units of blood here in the emergency room and go home tonight. The patient's son felt comfortable with his father's choice. This was done. The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells after appropriately typed and match. The patient did not have any adverse reaction at any point with his transfusion. There was no fever, no shortness of breath, and at the time of disposition, the patient stated he felt a little better and felt like he had a little more strength. Over the course of the patient's several-hour stay in the emergency room, the patient did end up developing enough problems with clotted blood in his bladder that he had a urinary obstruction. Foley catheter was placed, which produced bloody urine and relieved the developing discomfort of a full bladder. The patient was given a leg bag and the Foley catheter was left in place. DIAGNOSES 1. HEMATURIA. 2. PROSTATE CANCER WITH BONE AND BLADDER METASTATIC DISEASE. 3. SIGNIFICANT ANEMIA. 4. URINARY OBSTRUCTION. CONDITION ON DISPOSITION: Fair, but improved. DISPOSITION: To home with his son. PLAN: We will have the patient follow up with Dr. X in his office in 2 days for reevaluation. The patient was given a prescription for Levaquin and Phenergan tablets to take home with him tonight. The patient was encouraged to drink extra water. The patient was given discharge instructions on hematuria and asked to return to the emergency room should he have any worsening of his condition or develop any other problems or symptoms of concern."

Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right renal mass. 2. Hematuria. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right renal mass. 2. Right ureteropelvic junction obstruction. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Cystourethroscopy. 2. Right retrograde pyelogram. 3. Right ureteral pyeloscopy. 4. Right renal biopsy. 5. Right double-J 4.5 x 26 mm ureteral stent placement. ANESTHESIA: Sedation. SPECIMEN: Urine for cytology and culture sensitivity, right renal pelvis urine for cytology, and right upper pole biopsies. INDICATION: The patient is a 74-year-old male who was initially seen in the office with hematuria. He was then brought to the hospital for other medical problems and found to still have hematuria. He has a CAT scan with abnormal appearing right kidney and it was felt that he will benefit from cystoscope evaluation. PROCEDURE: After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. He was given IV sedation and placed in dorsal lithotomy position. He was then prepped and draped in the standard fashion. A #21 French cystoscope was then passed through his ureter on which patient was noted to have a hypospadias and passed through across the ends of the bladder. The patient was noted to have mildly enlarged prostate, however, it was non-obstructing. Upon visualization of the bladder, the patient was noted to have some tuberculation to the bladder. There were no masses or any other abnormalities noted other than the tuberculation. Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and an open-end of the catheter was then passed into the right ureteral orifice. A retrograde pyelogram was performed. Upon visualization, there was no visualization of the upper collecting system on the right side. At this point, a guidewire was then passed through the open-end of the ureteral catheter and the catheter was removed. The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed. The rigid ureteroscope was then passed into the bladder and into the right ureteral orifice with the assistance of a second glidewire. The ureteroscope was taken all the way through the proximal ureter just below the UPJ and there were noted to be no gross abnormalities. The ureteroscope was removed and an Amplatz wire then passed through the scope up into the collecting system along the side of the previous wire. The ureteroscope was removed and a ureteral dilating sheath was passed over the Amplatz wire into the right ureter under fluoroscopic guidance. The Amplatz wire was then removed and the flexible ureteroscope was passed through the sheath into the ureter. The ureteroscope was passed up to the UPJ at which point there was noted to be difficulty entering the ureter due to UPJ obstruction. The wire was then again passed through the flexible scope and the flexible scope was removed. A balloon dilator was then passed over the wire and the UPJ was dilated with balloon dilation. The dilator was then removed and again the cystoscope was passed back up into the right ureter and was able to enter the collecting system. Upon visualization of the collecting system of the upper portion, there was noted to be papillary mass within the collecting system. The ________ biopsy forceps were then passed through the scope and two biopsies were taken of the papillary mass. Once this was done, the wire was left in place and the ureteroscope was removed. The cystoscope was then placed back into the bladder and a 26 x 4.5 mm ureteral stent was passed over the wire under fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance into the right renal pelvis. The stent was noted to be clear within the right renal pelvis as well as in the bladder. The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well. He will be transferred to the recovery room and back to his room. It has been discussed with his primary physician that the patient will likely need a nephrectomy. He will be scheduled for an echocardiogram tomorrow and then decision will be made where the patient will be stable for possible nephrectomy on Wednesday."
Urology," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Penile cellulitis status post circumcision. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 16-month-old boy, who had a circumcision performed approximately 4 days before he developed penile swelling and fever and discharge. The child initially had a newborn circumcision at about 1 week of life and then developed a concealed or buried penis with extra skin and tightness of the skin. He underwent a second circumcision with a general anesthetic approximately 8 to 9 days ago. The mother states that on Thursday, he developed fairly significant swelling, scrotum was also swollen, the suprapubic region was swollen, and he was having a purulent discharge and a fairly significant fever to 102 to 103. He was seen at Hospital, transferred to Children's Hospital for further care. Since being hospitalized, his cultures apparently have grown Staph but is unknown yet whether it is methicillin-resistant. He has been placed on clindamycin, and he is now currently afebrile and with marked improvement according to the mother. I was requested a consultation by Dr. X because of the appearance of penis. The patient has been voiding without difficulty throughout. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has no known allergies. He was a term delivery via vaginal delivery. Surgeries; he has had 2 circumcisions. No other hospitalizations. He has had no heart murmurs, seizures, asthma, or bronchitis. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A 14-point review of systems was negative with the exception of the penile and scrotal cellulitis and the surgeries as mentioned. He also had an ear infection about 1 to 2 weeks before his circumcision. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with both parents and no siblings. There are smokers at home. MEDICATIONS: Clindamycin and bacitracin ointment. Also Bactrim. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Weight is 14.9 kg. GENERAL: The patient was sleepy but easily arousable. HEAD AND NECK: Grossly normal. His neck and chest are without masses. NARES: He had some crusted nares; otherwise, no other discharge. LUNGS: Clear. CARDIAC: Without murmurs or gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft without masses or tenderness. GU: He has a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad, and he is quite a large child in any event; however, there were no signs of erythema. There was some induration around the penis; however, there were no signs of active infection. He has a buried appearance of the penis after recent circumcision with a normal appearing glans. The tissue itself, however, was quite dull and is soft or readily retractable at this time. The scrotum was normal, and there was no erythema, there was no tenderness. Both testes were descended without hydroceles. EXTREMITIES: He has full range of motion of all 4 extremities. SKIN: Warm, pink, and dry. NEUROLOGIC: Grossly intact. BACK: Normal. IMPRESSION/PLAN: The patient had a recent circumcision with a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad but also has a penile and suprapubic cellulitis. This is being treated, but it is most likely Staph and pending sensitivities. I talked to the mother and told her that at this point the swelling that is present is a mixture of the resolving cellulitis from a suprapubic fat pad. I recommended that he be treated most likely with Bactrim for a 10-day course at home, bacitracin, or some antibiotics ointment to the penis with each diaper change for the next 2 to 3 weeks with sitz bath once or twice a day. I told the mother that initially the tissues are going to be quite dull because of the infection and the recent surgery, but she ultimately will have to gently retract the skin to keep it from adhering again because of the prominent suprapubic fat pad, which makes it more likely. Otherwise, it is a fairly healthy-appearing tissue at the present time and she knows the reasons that he cannot be discharged once the hospitalist service believes that it is appropriate to do so. He has a scheduled followup appointment with his urologist and he should keep that appointment or followup sooner if there is any other problem arising."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Left spermatocele. 2. Family planning. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Left spermatocele. 2. Family planning. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Left spermatocelectomy/epididymectomy. 2. Bilateral partial vasectomy. ANESTHESIA: General. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. SPECIMEN: Left-sided spermatocele, epididymis, and bilateral partial vasectomy. DISPOSITION: To PACU in stable condition. INDICATIONS AND FINDINGS: This is a 48-year-old male with a history of a large left-sided spermatocele with significant discomfort. The patient also has family status complete and desired infertility. The patient was scheduled for elective left spermatocelectomy and bilateral partial vasectomy. FINDINGS: At this time of the surgery, significant left-sided spermatocele was noted encompassing almost the entirety of the left epididymis with only minimal amount of normal appearing epididymis remaining. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was moved to the operating room. A general anesthesia was induced by the Department of Anesthesia. The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion for a scrotal approach. A #15 blade was used to make a transverse incision on the left hemiscrotum. Electrocautery was used to carry the incision down into the tunica vaginalis and the testicle was delivered into the field. The left testicle was examined. A large spermatocele was noted. Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect the tissue around the left spermatocele. Once the spermatocele was identified, as stated above, significant size was noted encompassing the entire left epididymis. Metzenbaum scissors as well as electrocautery was used to dissect free the spermatocele from its testicular attachments and spermatocelectomy and left epididymectomy was completed with electrocautery. Electrocautery was used to confirm excellent hemostasis. Attention was then turned to the more proximal aspect of the cord. The vas deferens was palpated and dissected free with Metzenbaum scissors. Hemostats were placed on the two aspects of the cord, approximately 1 cm segment of cord was removed with Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery was used to cauterize the lumen of the both ends of vas deferens and silk ties used to ligate the cut ends. Testicle was placed back in the scrotum in appropriate anatomic position. The dartos tissue was closed with running #3-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed in a horizontal interrupted mattress fashion with #4-0 chromic. Attention was then turned to the right side. The vas was palpated in the scrotum. A small skin incision was made with a #15 blade and the vas was grasped with a small Allis clamp and brought into the surgical field. A scalpel was used to excise the vas sheath and vas was freed from its attachments and grasped again with a hemostat. Two ends were hemostated with hemostats and divided with Metzenbaum scissors. Lumen was coagulated with electrocautery. Silk ties used to ligate both cut ends of the vas deferens and placed back into the scrotum. A #4-0 chromic suture was used in simple fashion to reapproximate the skin incision. Scrotum was cleaned and bacitracin ointment, sterile dressing, fluffs, and supportive briefs applied. The patient was sent to Recovery in stable condition. He was given prescriptions for doxycycline 100 mg b.i.d., for five days and Vicodin ES 1 p.o. q.4h. p.r.n., pain, #30 for pain. The patient is to followup with Dr. X in seven days."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Phimosis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Phimosis. OPERATIONS: Circumcision. ANESTHESIA: LMA. EBL: Minimal. FLUIDS: Crystalloid. BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 3-year-old male, who was referred to us from Dr. X's office with phimosis. The patient had spraying of urine and ballooning of the foreskin with voiding. The urine seemed to have collected underneath the foreskin and then would slowly drip out. Options such as dorsal slit, circumcision, watchful waiting by gently pulling the foreskin back were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, scarring, and expected complications were discussed. The patient's family understood all the complications and wanted to proceed with the procedure. Consent was obtained using interpreter. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in supine position. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. All the penile adhesions were released prior to the prepping. The extra foreskin was marked off, 1 x 3 Gamco clamp was used. Hemostasis was obtained after removing the extra foreskin using the Gamco clamp. Using 5-0 Monocryl, 4 quadrant stitches were placed and horizontal mattress suturing was done. There was excellent hemostasis. Dermabond was applied. The patient was brought to recovery at the end of the procedure in stable condition."
Urology," BILATERAL SCROTAL ORCHECTOMY PROCEDURE:: The patient is placed in the supine position, prepped and draped in the usual manner. Under satisfactory general anesthesia, the scrotum was approached and through a transverse mid scrotal incision, the right testicle was delivered through the incision. Hemostasis was obtained with the Bovie and the spermatic cord was identified. It was clamped, suture ligated with 0 chromic catgut and the cord above was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine for postoperative pain relief. The left testicle was delivered through the same incision. The spermatic cord was identified, clamped, suture ligated and that cord was also injected with 0.25% percent Marcaine. The incision was injected with the same material and then closed in two layers using 4-0 chromic catgut continuous for the dartos and interrupted for the skin. A dry sterile dressing fluff and scrotal support applied over that. The patient was sent to the Recovery Room in stable condition."
Urology," PROCEDURES: 1. Robotic-assisted pyeloplasty. 2. Anterograde right ureteral stent placement. 3. Transposition of anterior crossing vessels on the right. 4. Nephrolithotomy. DIAGNOSIS: Right ureteropelvic junction obstruction. DRAINS: 1. Jackson-Pratt drain times one from the right flank. 2. Foley catheter times one. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 30 cc. COMPLICATIONS: None. SPECIMENS: 1. Renal pelvis. 2. Kidney stones. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 30-year-old Caucasian gentleman with history of hematuria subsequently found to have right renal stones and patulous right collecting system with notable two right crossing renal arteries. Up on consideration of various modalities and therapy, the patient decided to undergo surgical therapy. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was verified by armband and the procedure being robotic-assisted right pyeloplasty with nephrolithotomy was verified, and the procedure was carried out. After institution of general endotracheal anesthesia and intravenous preoperative antibiotics, the patient was positioned into the right flank position with his right flank elevated. Great care was taken to pad all pressure points and a right arm hanger was used. The patient was flexed slightly, and a kidney rest was used. Sequential compression devices were also placed. Next, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with povidone-iodine. Pneumoperitoneum was obtained by placing a Veress needle in the area of the umbilicus after it passed the water test. A low pressure, high flow pneumoperitoneum was adequately obtained using CO2 gas. Next, a 12-mm camera port was placed near the umbilicus. The camera was inserted, and no bowel injury was seen. Next, under direct vision flanking 8 mm camera ports, a 12 mm assist port, a 5 mm liver retraction port, and 5 mm assist port were placed. The robot was docked and the instruments passed through respective checks. Initial attention was directed to mobilizing the right colon from the abdominal wall totally medially. Next, the right lateral duodenum was cauterized for further access to the right retroperitoneum. At this point, the right kidney was in clear view, and the fascia was entered. Initial attention was directed at careful dissection of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter which was done with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection. It became readily apparent that there were two crossing vessels one in the medial inferior region of the kidney and another one in the most inferior portion of the lower pole. These arteries were dissected carefully and vessel loops were applied. Next, a small hole was then made in the renal pelvis using electrocautery and the contents of the renal pelvis were suctioned out. The pyelotomy was extended so that the renal collecting system could be directly inspected. Sequentially, each major calyx was inspected under direct vision and irrigated. A total of four round kidney stones were extracted to be sent for analysis to being satisfied for the patient. At this point, we directed our attention at the proximal right ureter which was dismembered from the remaining renal pelvis. The proximal ureter was spatulated using cold scissors. Next, redundant renal pelvis was excised using cold scissors and sent for permanent section. We then identified the most inferior/dependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteral-renal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion. 3-0 Monocryl sutures were used to re-anastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis. Next, remainder of the pyelotomy was closed to itself also using 2-0 Monocryl sutures. Before final stitches were placed, a 6x28 ureteral stent was placed anterograde. This was accomplished by placing the stents over a guidewire, placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter. This was done until the proximal end was in the renal pelvis, the guidewire was removed, and good proximal curl was verified by direct vision. Then, the pyelotomy was completely closed again with 2-0 Monocryl sutures. Next, attention was directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with Vicryl suture that would impinge less upon the renal pelvis. Good pulsation was verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy sutures. Next, Gerota's fascia was reapproximated and closed with Vicryl sutures as was the right peritoneum. Hemostasis appeared excellent at this point. There was no obvious urine extravasation. At this time, the procedure was terminated. The robot was undocked. Under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm ports were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 Vicryl sutures in an interrupted fashion. Then, all skin port sites were closed with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and Dermabond and band-aids were applied over this. Also, notably a Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the area of the right kidney and additional right flank stab incision. The patient tolerated the procedure well and no immediate perioperative complication was noted. DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to Post Anesthesia Care Unit and subsequently to genitourinary floor to begin his recovery."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left direct and indirect inguinal hernia. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Repair of left inguinal hernia with Prolene mesh. ANESTHESIA: IV sedation with local. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to Recovery in stable condition. SPECIMEN: Hernia sac, as well as turbid fluid with gram stain, which came back with no organisms from the hernia sac. BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 53-year-old male who presented to Dr. Y's office with a bulge in the left groin and was found to have a left inguinal hernia increasing over the past several months. The patient has a history of multiple abdominal surgeries and opted for an open left inguinal hernial repair with Prolene mesh. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient was found to have a direct as well as an indirect component to the left inguinal hernia with a large sac. The patient was also found to have some turbid fluid within the hernia sac, which was sent down for gram stain and turned out to be negative with no organisms. PROCEDURE: After informed consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient, the patient was brought to the operative suite, prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion. The left inguinal ligament was identified from the pubic tubercle to the ASIS. Two fingerbreadths above the pubic tubercle, a transverse incision was made. First, the skin was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine and then an incision was made with a #15 blade scalpel, approximately 6 cm in length. Dissection was then carried down with electro Bovie cautery through Scarpa's fascia maintaining hemostasis. Once the external oblique was identified, external oblique was incised in the length of its fibers with a #15 blade scalpel. Metzenbaum scissors were then used to extend the incision in both directions opening up the external oblique down to the external ring. Next, the external oblique was grasped with Ochsner on both sides. The cord, cord structures as well as hernia sac were freed up circumferentially and a Penrose drain was placed around it. Next, the hernia sac was identified and the anteromedial portion of the hernia sac was stripped down, grasped with two hemostats. A Metzenbaum scissor was then used to open the hernia sac and the hernia sac was explored. There was some turbid fluid within the hernia sac, which was sent down for cultures. Gram stain was negative for organisms. Next, the hernia sac was to be ligated at its base and transected. A peon was used at the base. Metzenbaum scissor was used to cut the hernia sac and sending it off as a specimen. An #0 Vicryl stick suture was used with #0 Vicryl loop suture to suture ligate the hernia sac at its base. Next, attention was made to placing a Prolene mesh to cover the floor. The mesh was sutured to the pubic tubercle medially along the ilioinguinal ligament inferiorly and along the conjoint tendon superiorly making a slit for the cord and cord structures. Attention was made to salvaging the ilioinguinal nerve, which was left above the repair of the mesh and below the external oblique once closed and appeared to be intact. Attention was next made after suturing the mesh with the #2-0 Polydek suture. The external oblique was then closed over the roof with a running #0 Vicryl suture, taking care not to strangulate the cord and to recreate the external ring. After injecting the external oblique and cord structures with Marcaine for anesthetic, the Scarpa's fascia was approximated with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl suture. Steri-Strip with sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to Recovery in stable condition."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. OPERATIONS: Brachytherapy, iodine-125 seed implantation, and cystoscopy. ANESTHESIA: LMA. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. Total number of seeds placed, 63. Needles, 24. BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PATIENT: This is a 57-year-old male who was seen by us for elevated PSA. The patient had a prostate biopsy with T2b disease, Gleason 6. Options such as watchful waiting, robotic prostatectomy, seed implantation with and without radiation were discussed. Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, incontinence, rectal dysfunction, voiding issues, burning pain, unexpected complications such as fistula, rectal injury, urgency, frequency, bladder issues, need for chronic Foley for six months, etc., were discussed. The patient understood all the risks, benefits, and options, and wanted to proceed with the procedure. The patient was told that there could be other unexpected complications. The patient has history of urethral stricture. The patient was told about the risk of worsening of the stricture with radiation. Consent was obtained. DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. The patient had SCDs on. The patient was given preop antibiotics. The patient had done bowel prep the day before. Transrectal ultrasound was performed. The prostate was measured at about 32 gm. The images were transmitted to the computer system for radiation oncologist to determine the dosing etc. Based on the computer analysis, the grid was placed. Careful attention was drawn to keep the grid away from the patient. There was a centimeter distance between the skin and the grid. Under ultrasound guidance, the needles were placed, first in the periphery of the prostate, a total of 63 seeds were placed throughout the prostate. A total of 24 needles was used. Careful attention was drawn to stay away from the urethra. Under longitudinal ultrasound guidance, all the seeds were placed. There were no seeds visualized in the bladder under ultrasound. There was only one needle where the seeds kind of dragged as the needle was coming out on the left side and were dropped out of position. Other than that, all the seeds were very well distributed throughout the prostate under fluoroscopy. Please note that the Foley catheter was in place throughout the procedure. Prior to the seed placement, the Foley was attempted to be placed, but we had to do it using a Glidewire to get the Foley in and we used a Councill-tip catheter. The patient has had history of bulbar urethral stricture. Pictures were taken of the strictures in the pre-seed placement cysto time frame. We needed to do the cystoscopy and Glidewire to be able to get the Foley catheter in. At the end of the procedure, again cystoscopy was done, the entire bladder was visualized. The stricture was wide open. The prostate was slightly enlarged. The bladder appeared normal. There was no sheath inside the urethra or in the bladder. The cysto was done using 30-degree and 70-degree lens. At the end of the procedure, a Glidewire was placed, and 18 Councill-tip catheter was placed. The plan was for Foley to be left in place overnight since the patient has history of urethral strictures. The patient is to follow up tomorrow to have the Foley removed. The patient could also be shown to have it removed at home. The patient was brought to Recovery in stable condition at the end of the procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
Urology," REASON FOR VISIT: Follow up consultation, second opinion, foreskin. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 2-week-old who at this point has otherwise been doing well. He has a relatively unremarkable foreskin. At this point in time, he otherwise seems to be doing reasonably well. The question is about the foreskin. He otherwise has no other significant issues. Severity low, ongoing since birth two weeks. Thank you for allowing me to see this patient in consultation. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Male exam. Normal and under the penis, report normal uncircumcised 2-week-old. He has a slightly insertion on the penile shaft from the median raphe of the scrotum. IMPRESSION: Slightly high insertion of the median raphe. I see no reason he cannot be circumcised as long as they are careful and do a very complete Gomco circumcision. This kid should otherwise do reasonably well. PLAN: Follow up as needed. But my other recommendation is that this kid as I went over with the mother may actually do somewhat better if he simply has a formal circumcision at one year of age, but may do well with a person who is very accomplished doing a Gomco circumcision."
Urology," INDICATION: Prostate Cancer. TECHNIQUE: 3.5 hours following the intravenous administration of 26.5 mCi of Technetium 99m MDP, the skeleton was imaged in the anterior and posterior projections. FINDINGS: There is a focus of abnormal increased tracer activity overlying the right parietal region of the skull. The uptake in the remainder of the skeleton is within normal limits. The kidneys image normally. There is increased activity in the urinary bladder suggesting possible urinary retention. CONCLUSION: 1. Focus of abnormal increased tracer activity overlying the right parietal region of the skull. CT scanning of magnetic resonance imaging of the skull and brain could be done for further assessment if it is clinically indicated. 2. There is probably some degree of urinary retention."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left testicular torsion. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Left testicular torsion. 2. Left testicular abscess. 3. Necrotic testes. SURGERY: Left orchiectomy, scrotal exploration, right orchidopexy. DRAINS: Penrose drain on the left hemiscrotum. The patient was given vancomycin, Zosyn, and Levaquin preop. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 49-year-old male who came into the emergency room with 2-week history of left testicular pain, scrotal swelling, elevated white count of 39,000. The patient had significant scrotal swelling and pain. Ultrasound revealed necrotic testicle. Options such as watchful waiting and removal of the testicle were discussed. Due to elevated white count, the patient was told that he must have the testicle removed due to the infection and possible early signs of urosepsis. The risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, scrotal issues, other complications were discussed. The patient was told about the morbidity and mortality of the procedure and wanted to proceed. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. A midline scrotal incision was made. There was very, very thick scrotal skin. There was no necrotic skin. As soon as the left hemiscrotum was entered, significant amount of pus poured out of the left hemiscrotum. The testicle was completely filled with pus and had completely disintegrated with pus. The pus just poured out of the left testicle. The left testicle was completely removed. Debridement was done of the scrotal wall to remove any necrotic tissue. Over 2 L of antibiotic irrigation solution was used to irrigate the left hemiscrotum. There was good tissue left after all the irrigation and debridement. A Penrose drain was placed in the bottom of the left hemiscrotum. I worried about the patient may have torsed and then the testicle became necrotic, so the plan was to pex the right testicle, plus the right side also appeared very abnormal. So, the right hemiscrotum was opened. The testicle had significant amount of swelling and scrotal wall was very thick. The testicle appeared normal. There was no pus coming out of the right hemiscrotum. At this time, a decision was made to place 4-0 Prolene nonabsorbable stitches in 3 different quadrants to prevent it from torsion. The hemiscrotum was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in interrupted stitches and the skin was closed using 2-0 PDS in horizontal mattress. There was very minimal pus left behind and the skin was very healthy. Decision was made to close it to help the patient heal better in the long run. The patient was brought to the recovery in stable condition."
Urology," DIAGNOSIS: Desires vasectomy. NAME OF OPERATION: Vasectomy. ANESTHESIA: General. HISTORY: Patient, 37, desires a vasectomy. PROCEDURE: Through a midline scrotal incision, the right vas was identified and separated from the surrounding tissues, clamped, transected, and tied off with a 4-0 chromic. No bleeding was identified. Through the same incision the left side was identified, transected, tied off, and dropped back into the wound. Again no bleeding was noted. The wound was closed with 4-0 Vicryl times two. He tolerated the procedure well. A sterile dressing was applied. He was awakened and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right spermatocele. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right spermatocele. OPERATIONS PERFORMED: 1. Right spermatocelectomy. 2. Right orchidopexy. ANESTHESIA: Local MAC. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. FLUIDS: Crystalloid. BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PATIENT: The patient is a 77-year-old male who comes to the office with a large right spermatocele. The patient says it does bother him on and off, has occasional pain and discomfort with it, has difficulty with putting clothes on etc. and wanted to remove. Options such as watchful waiting, removal of the spermatocele or needle drainage were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, risk of infection, scrotal pain, and testicular pain were discussed. The patient was told that his scrotum may enlarge in the postoperative period for about a month and it will settle down. The patient was told about the risk of recurrence of spermatocele. The patient understood all the risks, benefits, and options and wanted to proceed with removal. DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient's scrotal area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A midline scrotal incision was made measuring about 2 cm in size. The incision was carried through the dartos through the scrotal sac and the spermatocele was identified. All the layers of the spermatocele were removed. Clear layer was visualized, was taken all the way up to the base, the base was tied. Entire spermatocele sac was removed. After removing the entire spermatocele sac, hemostasis was obtained. The testicle was not in normal orientation. The testis and epididymis was removed, which is a small appendage on the superior aspect of the testicle. The testicle was placed in a normal orientation. Careful attention was drawn not to twist the cord. Orchidopexy was done to allow the testes to stay stable in the postoperative period using 4-0 Vicryl and was tied at 3 different locations. Absorbable sutures were used, so that the patient does not feel the sutures in the postoperative period. The dartos was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in running locking fashion. There was excellent hemostasis. The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl. Dermabond was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was brought to the recovery room in stable condition."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Coronal hypospadias with chordee and asthma. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Coronal hypospadias with chordee and asthma. PROCEDURE: Hypospadias repair (TIP) with tissue flap relocation and chordee release (Nesbit tuck). ANESTHETIC: General inhalational anesthetic with a caudal block. FLUIDS RECEIVED: 300 mL of crystalloid. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 20 mL. TUBES/DRAINS: An 8-French Zaontz catheter. INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 17-month-old boy with hypospadias abnormality. The plan is for repair. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed. IV antibiotics were given. He was then placed in the supine position. The foreskin was retracted and cleansed. He was then sterilely prepped and draped. A stay stitch of 4-0 Prolene was then placed on the glans. The urethra was calibrated with the lacrimal duct probes to an 8-French. We then marked out the coronal cuff, the penile shaft skin as well as the glanular plate for future surgery with a marking pen. We then used a 15-blade knife to circumscribe the penis around the coronal cuff. We then degloved the penis using the curved tenotomy scissors, and electrocautery was used for hemostasis. The patient had some splaying of the spongiosum tissue, which was also incised laterally and rotated to make a secondary flap. Once the penis was degloved, and the excessive chordee tissue was released, we then placed a vessel loop tourniquet around the base of the penis and using IV grade saline injected the penis for an artifical erection. He was still noted to have chordee, so a midline incision through the Buck fascia was made with a 15-blade knife and Heineke-Mikulicz closure using 5-0 Prolene was then used for the chordee Nesbit tuck. We repeated the artificial erection and the penis was straight. We then incised the urethral plate with an ophthalmic blade in the midline, and then elevated the glanular wings using a 15-blade knife to elevate and then incise them. Using the curved iris scissors, we then also further mobilized the glanular wings. The 8-French Zaontz was then placed while the tourniquet was still in place into the urethral plate. The upper aspect of the distal meatus was then closed with an interrupted suture of 7-0 Vicryl, and then using a running subcuticular closure, we closed the urethral plates over the Zaontz catheter. We then mobilized subcutaneous tissue from the penile shaft skin, and the inner perpetual skin on the dorsum, and then buttonholed the flap, placed it over the head of the penis, and then, used it to cover of the hypospadias repair with tacking sutures of 7-0 Vicryl. We then rolled the spongiosum flap to cover the distal urethra that was also somewhat dysplastic; 7-0 Vicryl was used for that as well. 5-0 Vicryl was used to roll the glans with 2 deep sutures, and then, horizontal mattress sutures of 7-0 Vicryl were used to reconstitute the glans. Interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl were used to approximate the urethral meatus to the glans. Once this was done, we then excised the excessive penile shaft skin, and used the interrupted sutures of 6-0 chromic to attach the penile shaft skin to the coronal cuff. On the ventrum itself, we used horizontal mattress sutures to close the defect. At the end of the procedure, the Zaontz catheter was sutured into place with a 4-0 Prolene suture, Dermabond tissue adhesive, and Surgicel was used as a dressing and a second layer of Telfa and clear eye tape was then used to tape it into place. IV Toradol was given at the procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was in a stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Adrenal mass, right sided. 2. Umbilical hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Adrenal mass, right sided. 2. Umbilical hernia. OPERATION PERFORMED: Laparoscopic hand-assisted left adrenalectomy and umbilical hernia repair. ANESTHESIA: General. CLINICAL NOTE: This is a 52-year-old inmate with a 5.5 cm diameter nonfunctioning mass in his right adrenal. Procedure was explained including risks of infection, bleeding, possibility of transfusion, possibility of further treatments being required. Alternative of fully laparoscopic are open surgery or watching the lesion. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: In the right flank-up position, table was flexed. He had a Foley catheter in place. Incision was made from just above the umbilicus, about 5.5 cm in diameter. The umbilical hernia was taken down. An 11 mm trocar was placed in the midline, superior to the GelPort and a 5 mm trocar placed in the midaxillary line below the costal margin. A liver retractor was placed to this. The colon was reflected medially by incising the white line of Toldt. The liver attachments to the adrenal kidney were divided and the liver was reflected superiorly. The vena cava was identified. The main renal vein was identified. Coming superior to the main renal vein, staying right on the vena cava, all small vessels were clipped and then divided. Coming along the superior pole of the kidney, the tumor was dissected free from top of the kidney with clips and Bovie. The harmonic scalpel was utilized superiorly and laterally. Posterior attachments were divided between clips and once the whole adrenal was mobilized, the adrenal vein and one large adrenal artery were noted, doubly clipped, and divided. Specimen was placed in a collection bag, removed intact. Hemostasis was excellent. The umbilical hernia had been completely taken down. The edges were freshened up. Vicryl #1 was utilized to close the incision and 2-0 Vicryl was used to close the fascia of the trocar. Skin closed with clips. He tolerated the procedure well. All sponge and instrument counts were correct. Estimated blood loss less than 100 mL. The patient was awakened, extubated, and returned to recovery room in satisfactory condition."
Urology," REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Hematuria and urinary retention. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is an 82-year-old, who was admitted with the history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, presented with urinary retention and pneumonia. The patient had hematuria, and unable to void. The patient had a Foley catheter, which was not in the urethra, possibly inflated in the prostatic urethra, which was removed. Foley catheter was repositioned 18 Coude was used. About over a liter of fluids of urine was obtained with light pink urine, which was irrigated. The bladder and the suprapubic area returned to normal after the Foley placement. The patient had some evidence of clots upon irrigation. The patient has had a chest CT, which showed possible atelectasis versus pneumonia. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, Parkinson's, and CHF. FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory. SOCIAL HISTORY: Married and lives with wife. HABITS: No smoking or drinking. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Denies any chest pain, denies any seizure disorder, denies any nausea, vomiting. Does have suprapubic tenderness and difficulty voiding. The patient denies any prior history of hematuria, dysuria, burning, or pain. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: The patient is afebrile. Vitals are stable. GENERAL: The patient is a thin gentleman GENITOURINARY: Suprapubic area was distended and bladder was palpated very easily. Prostate was 1+. Testes are normal. LABORATORY DATA: The patient's white counts are 20,000. Creatinine is normal. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Pneumonia. 2. Dehydration. 3. Retention. 4. BPH. 5. Diabetes. 6. Hyperlipidemia. 7. Parkinson's. 8. Congestive heart failure. About 30 minutes were spent during the procedure and the Foley catheter was placed, Foley was irrigated and significant amount of clots were obtained. Plan is for urine culture, antibiotics. Plan is for renal ultrasound to rule out any pathology. The patient will need cystoscopy and evaluation of the prostate. Apparently, the patient's PSA is 0.45, so the patient is at low to no risk of prostate cancer at this time. Continued Foley catheter at this point. We will think about starting the patient on alpha-blockers once the patient's over all medical condition is improved and stable."
Urology," PROSTATE BRACHYTHERAPY - PROSTATE I-125 IMPLANTATION This patient will be treated to the prostate with ultrasound-guided I-125 seed implantation. The original consultation and treatment planning will be separately performed. At the time of the implantation, special coordination will be required. Stepping ultrasound will be performed and utilized in the pre-planning process. Some discrepancies are frequently identified, based on the positioning, edema, and/or change in the tumor since the pre-planning process. Re-assessment is required at the time of surgery, evaluating the pre-plan and comparing to the stepping ultrasound. Modifications will be made in real time to add or subtract needles and seeds as required. This may be integrated with the loading of the seeds performed by the brachytherapist, as well as coordinated with the urologist, dosimetrist or physicist. The brachytherapy must be customized to fit the individual's tumor and prostate. Attention is given both preoperatively and intraoperatively to avoid overdosage of rectum and bladder."
Urology," REASON FOR VISIT: Overactive bladder with microscopic hematuria. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 56-year-old noted to have microscopic hematuria with overactive bladder. Her cystoscopy performed was unremarkable. She continues to have some episodes of frequency and urgency mostly with episodes during the day and rare at night. No gross hematuria, dysuria, pyuria, no other outlet obstructive and/or irritative voiding symptoms. The patient had been previously on Ditropan and did not do nearly as well. At this point, what we will try is a different medication. Renal ultrasound is otherwise unremarkable, notes no evidence of any other disease. IMPRESSION: Overactive bladder with microscopic hematuria most likely some mild atrophic vaginitis is noted. She has no other significant findings other than her overactive bladder, which had continued. At this juncture what I would like to do is try a different anticholinergic medication. She has never had any side effects from her medication. PLAN: The patient will discontinue Ditropan. We will start Sanctura XR and we will follow up as scheduled. Otherwise we will continue to follow her urinalysis over the next year or so."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Nonpalpable right undescended testis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Nonpalpable right undescended testis with atrophic right testis. PROCEDURES: Examination under anesthesia, diagnostic laparoscopy, right orchiectomy, and left testis fixation. ANESTHESIA: General inhalation anesthetic with caudal block. FLUID RECEIVED: 250 mL of crystalloids. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. SPECIMEN: The tissue sent to Pathology was right testicular remnant. ABNORMAL FINDINGS: Closed ring on right with atrophic vessels going into the ring and there was obstruction at the shoulder of the ring. Left had open appearing ring but the scrotum was not filled and vas and vessels going into the ring. INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 2-year-old boy with a right nonpalpable undescended testis. The plan is for evaluation and repair. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed. The patient was placed in supine position and examined. The left testis well within scrotum. The right was again not palpable despite the patient being asleep with multiple attempts to check. The patient was then sterilely prepped and draped. An 8-French feeding tube was then placed within his bladder through the urethra and attached to the drainage. We then incised the infraumbilical area once he was sterilely prepped and draped, with 15 blade knife, then using Hasson technique with stay stitches in the anterior and posterior rectus fascia sheath of 3-0 Monocryl. We entered the peritoneum with the 5-mm one-step system. We then used the short 0-degree lens for laparoscopy. We then insufflated with carbon dioxide insufflation to pressure of 12 mmHg. There was no bleeding noted upon evaluation of the abdomen and again the findings were as mentioned with closed ring with vas and vessels going to the left and vessels and absent vas on the right where the closed ring was found. Because there was no testis found in the abdomen, we then evacuated the gas and closed the fascial sheath with the 3-0 Monocryl tacking sutures. Then skin was closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 Rapide. A curvilinear upper scrotal incision was made on the right with 15 blade knife and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis. A curved tenotomy scissor was used to open the sac. The tunica vaginalis was visualized and grasped and then dissected up towards external ring. There was no apparent testicular tissue. We did remove it, however, tying off the cord structure with a 4-0 Vicryl suture and putting a tagging suture at the base of the tissue sent. We then closed the subdartos area with the subcutaneous closure of 4-0 chromic. We then did a similar curvilinear incision on the left side for testicular fixation. Delivered the testis into the field, which had a type III epididymal attachment and was indeed about 3 to 4 mL in size, which was larger than expected for the patient's age. We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with the 4-0 chromic pursestring suture and placed testis back into the scrotum in the proper orientation and closed the dartos, skin, and subcutaneous closure with 4-0 chromic on left hemiscrotum. At the end of the procedure, the patient received IV Toradol and had Dermabond tissue adhesive placed on both incisions and left testis was well descended in the scrotum at the end of the procedure. The patient tolerated procedure well, and was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room."
Urology," CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient comes for bladder instillation for chronic interstitial cystitis. SUBJECTIVE: The patient is crying today when she arrives in the office saying that she has a lot of discomfort. These bladder instillations do not seem to be helping her. She feels anxious and worried. She does not think she can take any more pain. She is debating whether or not to go back to Dr. XYZ and ask for the nerve block or some treatment modality to stop the pain because she just cannot function on a daily basis and care for her children unless she gets something done about this, and she fears these bladder instillations because they do not seem to help. They seem to be intensifying her pain. She has the extra burden of each time she comes needing to have pain medication one way or another, thus then we would not allow her to drive under the influence of the pain medicine. So, she has to have somebody come with her and that is kind of troublesome to her. We discussed this at length. I did suggest that it was completely appropriate for her to decide. She will terminate these if they are that uncomfortable and do not seem to be giving her any relief, although I did tell her that occasionally people do have discomfort with them and then after the completion of the instillations, they do better and we have also had some people who have had to terminate the instillations because they were too uncomfortable and they could not stand it and they went on to have some other treatment modality. She had Hysterectomy in the past. MEDICATIONS: Premarin 1.25 mg daily, Elmiron 100 mg t.i.d., Elavil 50 mg at bedtime, OxyContin 10 mg three tablets three times a day, Toprol XL 25 mg daily. ALLERGIES: Compazine and Allegra. OBJECTIVE: Vital Signs: Weight: 140 pounds. Blood pressure: 132/90. Pulse: 102. Respirations: 18. Age: 27. PLAN: We discussed going for another evaluation by Dr. XYZ and seeking his opinion. She said that she called him on the phone the other day and told him how miserable she was and he told her that he really thought she needed to complete. The instillations give that a full trial and then he would be willing to see her back. As we discussed these options and she was encouraged to think it over and decide what she would like to do for I could not makeup her mind for her. She said she thought that it was unreasonable to quit now when she only had two or three more treatments to go, but she did indicate that the holiday weekend coming made her fearful and if she was uncomfortable after today�s instillation which she did choose to take then she would choose to cancel Friday�s appointment, also that she would not feel too badly over the holiday weekend. I thought that was reasonable and agreed that that would work out. PROCEDURE:: She was then given 10 mg of morphine subcutaneously because she did not feel she could tolerate the discomfort in the instillation without pain medicine. We waited about 20 minutes. The bladder was then instilled and the urethra was instilled with lidocaine gel which she tolerated and then after a 10-minute wait, the bladder was instilled with DMSO, Kenalog, heparin, and sodium bicarbonate, and the catheter was removed. The patient retained the solution for one hour, changing position every 15 minutes and then voided to empty the bladder. She seemed to tolerate it moderately well. She is to call and let me know what she wishes to do about the Friday scheduled bladder instillation if she tolerated this then she is going to consider trying it. If not, she will cancel and will start over next week or she will see Dr. Friesen."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right direct inguinal hernia. PROCEDURE: Right direct inguinal hernia repair with PHS mesh system. ANESTHESIA: General with endotracheal intubation. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table. General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation. The Right groin and abdomen were prepped and draped in the standard sterile surgical fashion. An incision was made approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the pubic tubercle and in a skin crease. Dissection was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Scarpa's fascia was divided, and the external ring was located. The external oblique was divided from the external ring up towards the anterior superior iliac spine. The cord structures were then encircled. Careful inspection of the cord structures did not reveal any indirect sac along the cord structures. I did, however, feel a direct sac with a direct defect. I opened the floor of the inguinal canal and dissected out the preperitoneal space at the direct sac and cut out the direct sac. Once I cleared out the preperitoneal space, I placed a PHS mesh system with a posterior mesh into the preperitoneal space, and I made sure that it laid flat along Cooper's ligament and covered the myopectineal orifice. I then tucked the extended portion of the anterior mesh underneath the external oblique between the external oblique and the internal oblique, and I then tacked the medial portion of the mesh to the pubic tubercle with a 0 Ethibond suture. I tacked the superior portion of the mesh to the internal oblique and the inferior portion of the mesh to the shelving edge of the inguinal ligament. I cut a hole in the mesh in order to incorporate the cord structures and recreated the internal ring, making sure that it was not too tight so that it did not strangulate the cord structures. I then closed the external oblique with a running 3-0 Vicryl. I closed the Scarpa's with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and I closed the skin with a running Monocril. Sponge, instrument and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well and without any complications."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Desire for sterility. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Desire for sterility. OPERATIVE PROCEDURES: Vasectomy. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the suite, where after oral sedation, the scrotum was prepped and draped. Then, 1% lidocaine was used for anesthesia. The vas was identified, skin was incised, and no scalpel instruments were used to dissect out the vas. A segment about 3 cm in length was dissected out. It was clipped proximally and distally, and then the ends were cauterized after excising the segment. Minimal bleeding was encountered and the scrotal skin was closed with 3-0 chromic. The identical procedure was performed on the contralateral side. He tolerated it well. He was discharged from the surgical center in good condition with Tylenol with Codeine for pain. He will use other forms of birth control until he has confirmed azoospermia with two consecutive semen analyses in the month ahead. Call if there are questions or problems prior to that time."
Urology," Thank you for allowing me to help in the evaluation of the patient who, as you know, is a 44-year-old male with a history of a skin lesion for approximately one year now. It has been given a label in the past of a skin tag. The patient states it is not painful, has had no trauma or bleeding to that area. The patient is interested in evaluation because he is on the move with his work and would like it taken care of. He has no voiding complaints and no history of sexually transmitted diseases. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: None. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Back surgery with a fusion of L5-S1. MEDICATIONS: He does take occasional Percocet for his back discomfort. ALLERGIES: HE HAS NO ALLERGIES. SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a smoker. He takes rare alcohol. His employment is that he does dynamite work and actually putting in the dynamite in large holes for destroying ground to that pipeline can be laid. He travels to anywhere for his work. He is married with one son. FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for prostate cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, enlarged prostate or kidney disease. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative for tremors, headaches, dizzy spells, numbness, tingling, feeling hot or cold, tired or sluggishness, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, indigestion, heartburn, fevers, chills, weight loss, wheezing, frequent cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, varicose veins, high blood pressure, skin rash, joint pain, ear infections, sore throat, sinus problems, hay fever, blood clotting problems, depressive affect or eye problems. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION GENERAL: The patient is afebrile. His vital signs are stable. He is 177 pounds, 5 feet, 8 inches. Blood pressure 144/66. He is healthy appearing. He is alert and oriented x 3. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender. His penis is circumcised. He has a pedunculated cauliflower-like lesion on the dorsum of the penis at approximately 12 o'clock. It is very obvious and apparent. He also has a mildly raised brown lesion that the patient states has been there ever since he can remember and has not changed in size or caliber. His testicles are descended bilaterally. There are no masses. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is likely molluscum contagiosum (genital warts) caused by HPV. I did state to the patient that this is likely a viral infection that could have had a long incubation period. It is not clear where this came from but it is most likely sexually transmitted. He is instructed that he should use protected sex from this point on in order to try and limit the transmission. Regarding the actual lesion itself, I did mention that we could apply a cream of Condylox, which could take up to a month to work. I also offered him C02 laser therapy for the genital warts, which is an outpatient procedure. The patient is very interested in something quick and effective such as a CO2 laser procedure. I did state that the recurrence rate is significant and somewhere as high as 20% despite enucleating these lesions. The patient understood this and still wished to proceed. There is minimal risk otherwise except for those inherent in laser injury and accidental injury. The patient understood and wished to proceed."
Urology," PROCEDURE: Circumcision. ANESTHESIA: EMLA. FINDINGS: Normal penis. The foreskin was normal in appearance and measured 1.6 cm. There was no bleeding at the circumcision site. PROCEDURE: Patient was placed on the circumcision restraint board. EMLA had been applied approximately 90 minutes before. A time-out was completed satisfactorily per protocol. The area was prepped with Betadine. The foreskin was grasped with sterile clamps and was dissected away from the corona and the glans penis with blunt dissection. A Mogen clamp was applied to the cervix. The excess foreskin was excised with the scalpel. The clamp was removed. At this point, the procedure was terminated. Sterile Vaseline and gauze was applied to the glans penis. There were no complications. There was minimal blood loss."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Direct inguinal hernia. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rutkow direct inguinal herniorrhaphy. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. Preoperative antibiotics were given for prophylaxis against surgical infection. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A standard inguinal incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery. The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated. The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel and this incision was carried out to the external ring using Metzenbaum scissors. Having exposed the inguinal canal, the cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a Penrose drain was placed around the cord structures at the level of the pubic tubercle. This Penrose drain was then used to retract the cord structures as needed. Adherent cremasteric muscle was dissected free from the cord using Bovie electrocautery. The cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and no sac was found. The hernia was found coming from the floor of the inguinal canal medial to the inferior epigastric vessels. This was dissected back to the hernia opening. The hernia was inverted back into the abdominal cavity and a large PerFix plug inserted into the ring. The plug was secured to the ring by interrupted 2-0 Prolene sutures. The PerFix onlay patch was then placed on the floor of the inguinal canal and secured in place using interrupted 2-0 Prolene sutures. By reinforcing the floor with the onlay patch, a new internal ring was thus formed. The Penrose drain was removed. The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery. The incision in the external oblique was approximated using a 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion, thus reforming the external ring. The skin incision was approximated with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct. Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
Urology," ADMITTING DIAGNOSES: 1. Hematuria. 2. Benign prostatic hyperplasia. 3. Osteoarthritis. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Hematuria, resolved. 2. Benign prostatic hyperplasia. 3. Complex renal cyst versus renal cell carcinoma or other tumor. 4. Osteoarthritis. HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 77-year-old African-American male who was previously well until he began having gross hematuria and clots passing through his urethra on the day of admission. He stated that he never had blood in his urine before, however, he does have a past history of BPH and he had a transurethral resection of prostate more than 10 years ago. He was admitted to a regular bed. Dr. G of Urology was consulted for evaluation of his hematuria. During the workup for this, he had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast with early and late-phase imaging for evaluation of the kidneys and collecting system. At that time, he was shown to have multiple bilateral renal cysts with one that did not meet classification as a simple cyst and ultrasound was recommended. He had an ultrasound done of the cyst which showed a 2.1 x 2.7 cm mass arising from the right kidney which, again, did not fit ultrasound criteria for a simple cyst and they recommended further evaluation by an MRI as this could be a hemorrhagic cyst or a solid mass or tumor, so an MRI was scheduled on the day of discharge for further evaluation of this. The report was not back at discharge. The patient had a cystoscopy and transurethral resection of prostate as well with entire resection of the prostate gland. Pathology on this specimen showed multiple portions of prostatic tissue which was primarily fibromuscular, and he was diagnosed with nonprostatic hyperplasia. His urine slowly cleared. He tolerated a regular diet with no difficulties in his activities of daily living, and his Foley was removed on the day of discharge. He was started on ciprofloxacin, Colace, and Lasix after the transurethral resection and continued these for a short course. He is asked to continue the Colace as an outpatient for stool softening for comfort. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Colace 100 mg 1 b.i.d. DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP PLANNING: The patient is to follow up with his primary care physician at ABCD, Dr. B or Dr. J, the patient is unsure of which, in the next couple weeks. He is to follow up with Dr. G of Urology in the next week by phone in regards to the patient's MRI and plans for a laparoscopic partial renal resection biopsy. This is scheduled for the week after discharge potentially by Dr. G, and the patient will discuss the exact time later this week. The patient is to return to the emergency room or to our clinic if he has worsening hematuria again or no urine output."

Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bilateral inguinal hernia, bilateral hydroceles. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bilateral inguinal hernia, bilateral hydroceles. PROCEDURES: Bilateral inguinal hernia and bilateral hydrocele repair with an ilioinguinal nerve block bilaterally by surgeon 20 mL given. ANESTHESIA: General inhalational anesthetic. ABNORMAL FINDINGS: Same as above. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. FLUIDS RECEIVED: 400 mL of Crystalloid. DRAINS: No tubes or drains were used. COUNT: Sponge and needle counts were correct x2. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 7-year-old boy with the history of fairly sizeable right inguinal hernia and hydrocele, was found to have a second smaller one on evaluation with ultrasound and physical exam. Plan is for repair of both. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site and the patient's identification was verified. Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in a supine position and sterilely prepped and draped. A right inguinal incision was then made with 15 blade knife and further extended with electrocautery down to the subcutaneous tissue and electrocautery was also used for hemostasis. The external oblique fascia was then visualized and incised with 15 blade knife and further extended with curved tenotomy scissors. Using a curved mosquito clamp, we gently dissected into the inguinal canal until we got the hernia sac and dissected it out of the canal. The cord structures were then dissected off the sac and then the sac itself was divided in the midline, twisted upon itself and suture ligated up at the peritoneal reflection with 3-0 Vicryl suture. This was done twice. The distal end where a large hydrocele noted, was gently milked into the lower aspect of the incision. The hydrocele sac was then opened and drained and then the testis was delivered into the field. The sac was then opened completely around the testis. The appendix testis was cauterized. We wrapped the sac around the back of the testis and tacked into place using the Lord maneuver using 4-0 Vicryl as a figure-of-eight suture. Once this was done, the testis was then placed back into the scrotum in the proper orientation. Ilioinguinal nerve block and wound instillation was then done with 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine. A similar procedure was done on the left side, also finding a small hernia, which was divided and ligated with the 3-0 Vicryl as on the right side and distally the hydrocele sac was also wrapped around the back of the testis in a Lord maneuver after opening the sac completely. Again both testes were placed into the scrotum after the hydroceles were treated and then the external oblique fascia was closed on both sides with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl ensuring that the ilioinguinal nerve and the cord structures not involved in the closure. Scarpa fascia was closed with 4-0 chromic suture on each side and the skin was closed with 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure. Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed on both incisions. IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure and both testes were well descended within the scrotum at the end of the procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure and was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room."

Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right hydronephrosis. 2. Right flank pain. 3. Atypical/dysplastic urine cytology. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right hydronephrosis. 2. Right flank pain. 3. Atypical/dysplastic urine cytology. 4. Extrarenal pelvis on the right. 5. No evidence of obstruction or ureteral/bladder lesions. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Cystoscopy. 2. Bilateral retrograde ureteropyelograms. 3. Right ureteral barbotage for urine cytology. 4. Right ureterorenoscopy, diagnostic. ANESTHESIA: Spinal. SPECIMEN TO PATHOLOGY: Urine and saline wash barbotage from right ureter through the ureteral catheter. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This is a 70-year-old female who reports progressive intermittent right flank pain associated with significant discomfort and disability. She presented to the emergency room where she was found to have significant hydronephrosis on the right without evidence of a stone. She has some ureteral thickening in her distal right ureter. She has persistent microscopic hematuria and her urine cytology and cytomolecular diagnosis significant for urothelial dysplasia with neoplasia-associated karyotypic profile. She was brought to the operating room for further evaluation and treatment. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: After preoperative counseling, the patient was taken to the operating room and administered a spinal anesthesia. She was placed in the lithotomy position, prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The 21-French cystoscope was inserted per urethra into the bladder. The bladder was inspected and found to be without evidence of intravesical tumors, stones or mucosal abnormalities. The right ureteral orifice was visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter. This was gently advanced to the mid ureter. Urine was collected for cytology. Retrograde injection of saline through the ureteral catheter was then also used to enhance collection of the specimen. This too was collected and sent for a pooled urine cytology as specimen from the right renal pelvis and ureter. An 0.038 guidewire was then passed up through the open-ended ureteral catheter. The open-ended ureteral catheter and cystoscope were removed, and over the guidewire the flexible ureteroscope was passed up to the level of the renal pelvis. Using direct vision and fluoroscopy to confirm location, the entire renal pelvis and calyces were inspected. The renal pelvis demonstrated an extrarenal pelvis, but no evidence of obstruction at the renal UPJ level. There were no intrapelvic or calyceal stones. The ureter demonstrated no significant mucosal abnormalities, no visible tumors, and no areas of apparent constriction on multiple passes of the ureteroscope through the ureter to evaluate. The ureteroscope was then removed. The cystoscope was reinserted. Once again, retrograde injection of contrast through an open-ended ureteral catheter was undertaken in the right ureter and collecting system. No evidence of extravasation or significant change in anatomy was visualized. The left ureteral orifice was then visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter, and retrograde injection of contrast demonstrated a normal left ureter and collecting system. The cystoscope was removed. Foley catheter was inserted. The patient was placed in the supine position and transferred to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."
Urology," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Testicular pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 4-year-old boy with a history of abrupt onset of left testicular pain at 11:30 this morning. He was unable to walk and would not stand upright, and had fairly significant discomfort, so the parents checked his panel because of it. Because of this, they took him to Emergency Department, at which time, he had no swelling noted initially, but very painful. He had no voiding or stooling problems. No nausea, vomiting or fever. Family denies trauma or dysuria. At that time, he was going to get an ultrasound done, but the mother said that all of sudden the patient stated the pain had resolved. He has had hot chocolate this morning at 10:30 in the morning and water around 2:30 in the morning. He has not had any pain since but states that he has had pain in the past, not as long and states there was a twisting sensation. He has no recent cold or flu, although he had rhinorrhea about 3 weeks ago. He is on no medications and he is here for evaluation. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has no known allergies. He is term delivery via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He has had no problems or hospitalizations with circumcision. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: He has had no previous surgeries. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: All 14-point review of systems were negative except for the above left testicular pain and the history of possible upper respiratory infection about 2 to 3 weeks ago. IMMUNIZATIONS: Up-to-date. FAMILY HISTORY: The patient lives at home with both parents who are Spanish speaking. He is not in school. MEDICATIONS: He is on no medications. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: On physical exam, weight is 15.9 kg. GENERAL: The patient is a cooperative little boy. HEENT: Normal head and neck exam. No oral or nasal discharge. NECK: Without masses. CHEST: Without masses. LUNGS: Clear. CARDIAC: Without murmurs or gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft. No masses or tenderness. His scrotum did not have any swelling at the present time. There was only minimal discomfort with palpation at the left inguinal area, but no masses were noted. No palpable nodules such as appendix testis and no swelling was noted and he had mild epididymal swelling only. His left testis was slightly harder than the right, but this was not very significant. EXTREMITIES: He had full range of motion in all 4 extremities. SKIN: Warm, pink, and dry. NEUROLOGIC: Grossly intact. LABORATORY DATA: Ultrasound was obtained today showing no blood flow or poor blood flow on the left except for increased blood flow to the epididymis on the study done at about 1330 hours, and second one done around 1630 hours was normal flow, possible increased flow on the left. This is personally reviewed by me. The right was normal. No masses were appreciated. There was some mild change in echotexture on the left on the initial study, which had apparently resolved on the second, but may be due to the technical aspects of the study. ASSESSMENT/PLAN: The patient has a possibly torsion detorsion versus other acute testicular problem. If the patient has indeed testicular torsion, there is an increased possibility that it may reoccur again, actually within the first 24 to 36 hours and as such is recommended doing a left scrotal exploration with possible detorsion of left testis, possible orchiectomy if the testis is markedly abnormal or nonviable, which probably is not the case, and bilateral testes fixation if the torsion is found. I discussed the pre and postsurgical care with the parents. Procedure itself with potential complications, risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery including that the torsion could occur again, although it is less likely after the surgical fixation procedure. The parents understand and wished to proceed. We will schedule this later today emergently."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bladder laceration. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bladder laceration. NAME OF OPERATION: Closure of bladder laceration. FINDINGS: The patient was undergoing a cesarean section for twins. During the course of the procedure, a bladder laceration was notices and urology was consulted. Findings were a laceration on the dome of the bladder. PROCEDURE: Initially there as a mucosal layer of suture already placed. This was done with 3-0 chromic catgut. The bladder was distended and, while the bladder was distended with physiologic saline, a second layer of 3-0 chromic catgut created a watertight closure. The second layer included the mucosa an dinner layer of the detrusor muscle. A third layer of 2-0 Dexon was used. Each of these were placed in a continuous running-locked suture technique. There was complete watertight closure of the bladder. Hemostasis was assured and a Jackson-Pratt drain was brought out through a separate stab wound. The remaining portion of the operation, both the cesarean section and the wound closure, will be dictated by Dr. Redmond."
Urology," ADMITTING DIAGNOSES: Solitary left kidney with obstruction, and hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Solitary left kidney with obstruction and hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency, plus a Pseudomonas urinary tract infection. PROCEDURES: Cystoscopy under anesthesia, ureteroscopy, an attempted tube placement, stent removal with retrograde pyelography, percutaneous tube placement, and nephrostomy by Radiology. PERTINENT LABORATORIES: Creatinine of 1.4. During the hospitalization it was decreased to 0.8 and Pseudomonas urinary tract infection, positive culture sensitive to ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 3-1/2-year-old boy with a solitary kidney, had a ureteropelvic junction repair performed by Dr. Y, in the past, unfortunately, it was thought still be obstructed. A stent was placed approximately 6 weeks ago after urethroscopic placement with some difficulty. Plan was to remove the stent. At the time of removal, we were unable to place another tube within the collecting system, and the patient was admitted for percutaneous nephrostomy placement. He has had no recent cold or flu. He has problems with hypertension for which he is on enalapril at home in addition to his Macrodantin prophylaxis. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has no known allergies. Multiple urinary tract infection, solitary kidney, and previous surgeries as mentioned above. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A 14-organ system review of systems is negative except for the history of present illness. He also has history of being a 34-week preemie twin. ALLERGIES: No known allergies. FAMILY HISTORY: Unremarkable without any bleeding or anesthetic problems. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives at home with his parents, 2 brothers, and a sister. IMMUNIZATIONS: Up-to-date. MEDICATIONS: On admission was Macrodantin, hydralazine, and enalapril. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is an active little boy. HEENT: The head and neck exam was grossly normal. He had no oral, ocular, or nasal discharge. LUNGS: Exam was normal without wheezing. HEART: Without murmur or gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft, without mass or tenderness with a well-healed flank incision. GU: Uncircumcised male with bilaterally descended testes. EXTREMITIES: He has full range of motion in all 4 extremities. SKIN: Warm, pink, and dry. NEUROLOGIC: Grossly intact. BACK: He has normal back. Normal gait. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the hospital after inability to place a ureteral stent via ureteroscopy and cystoscopy. He was made NPO. He had a fever at first time with elevated creatinine. He was also evaluated and treated by Dr. X, for fluid management, hypertensive management, and gave him some hydralazine and Lasix to improve his urine output, in addition to manage his blood pressure. Once the percutaneous tube was placed, we found that his urine culture grew Pseudomonas, so he was kept on Fortaz, and was switched over to ciprofloxacin without difficulty. He, otherwise, did well with continuing decrease his creatinine at the time of discharge to home. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with ciprofloxacin, enalapril, and recommendation for followup in Urology in 1 to 2 weeks for the surgical correction in 2 to 3 weeks of repeat pyeloplasty or possible ureterocalicostomy. The patient had draining nephrostomy tube without difficulty."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Urinary retention. 2. Benign prostate hypertrophy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Urinary retention. 2. Benign prostate hypertrophy. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Cystourethroscopy. 2. Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP). ANESTHESIA: Spinal. RESECTION TIME: Less than one hour. INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: This is a 62-year-old male with a history of urinary retention and progressive obstructive voiding symptoms and enlarged prostate 60 g on ultrasound, office cystoscopy confirmed this. PROCEDURE: PROCEDURE: Informed written consent was obtained. The patient was taken to the operative suite, administered spinal anesthetic and placed in dorsal lithotomy position. She was sterilely prepped and draped in normal fashion. A #27-French resectoscope was inserted utilizing the visual obturator blanching the bladder. The bladder was visualized in all quadrants, no bladder tumors or stones were noted. Ureteral orifices were visualized and did appear to be near the enlarged median lobe. Prostate showed trilobar prostatic enlargement. There were some cellules and tuberculations noted. The visual obturator was removed. The resectoscope was then inserted utilizing the #26 French resectoscope loop. Resection was performed initiating at the bladder neck and at the median lobe. This was taken down to the circular capsular fibers. Attention was then turned to the left lateral lobe and this was resected from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock down to the capsular fibers maintaining hemostasis along the way and taking care not to resect beyond the level of the verumontanum. Ureteral orifices were kept out of harm's way throughout the case. Resection was then performed from the 3 o'clock position to the 6 o'clock position in similar fashion. Attention was then turned to the right lateral lobe and this was resected again in a similar fashion maintaining hemostasis along the way. The resectoscope was then moved to the level of the proximal external sphincter and trimming of the apex was performed. Open prostatic fossa was noted. All chips were evacuated via Ellik evacuator and #24 French three-way Foley catheter was inserted and irrigated. Clear return was noted. The patient was then hooked up to better irrigation. The patient was cleaned, reversed for anesthetic, and transferred to recovery room in stable condition. PLAN: We will admit with antibiotics, pain control, and bladder irrigation possible void trial in the morning."

Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Carcinoma of the prostate, clinical stage T1C. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Carcinoma of the prostate, clinical stage T1C. TITLE OF OPERATION: Cystoscopy, cryosurgical ablation of the prostate. FINDINGS: After measurement of the prostate, we decided to place 5 rows of needles--row #1 had 3 needles, row #2 at the level of the mid-prostate had 4 needles, row #3 had 2 needles in the right lateral peripheral zone, row #4 was a single needle directly the urethra, and in row #5 were 2 needles placed in the left lateral peripheral zone. Because of the length of the prostate, a pull-back was performed, pulling row #2 approximately 3 mm and rows #3, #4 and #5 approximately 1 cm back before refreezing. OPERATION IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the patient was positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position. Full bowel prep had been obtained prior to the procedure. After performing flexible cystoscopy, a Foley catheter was placed per urethra into the bladder. Next, the ultrasound probe was placed into the stabilizer and advanced into the rectum. An excellent ultrasound image was visualized of the entire prostate, which was re-measured. Next, the probe template was positioned over the perineum and the template guide brought up on the ultrasound screen in order to guide needle placement. Then 17-gauge needles were serially placed into the prostate, from an anterior to posterior direction into the prostate. Ultrasound guidance demonstrated that these needles, numbering approximately 14 to 15 needles, were well placed and spaced throughout the prostate to obtain excellent freezing of the entire gland while sparing the urethra. Repeat cystoscopy demonstrated a single needle passing through the urethra; and due to the high anterior location of this needle, it was removed. The CMS urethral warmer was then passed per urethra into the bladder, and flow instituted. After placing these 17-gauge needles, the prostate was then frozen down to minus 150 degrees for 10 minutes in sequential fashion from anterior to posterior. The ice ball was monitored and was seen to extend through the capsule of the prostate toward the rectum but not through the rectal wall itself. Active warming was then performed before refreezing the prostate again and then passively warming it back to room temperature. The urethral warmer was left on after the needles were removed and the patient brought to the recovery room. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in stable condition."
Urology," DESCRIPTION: The patient was placed in the supine position and was prepped and draped in the usual manner. The left vas was grasped in between the fingers. The skin and vas were anesthetized with local anesthesia. The vas was grasped with an Allis clamp. Skin was incised and the vas deferens was regrasped with another Allis clamp. The sheath was incised with a scalpel and elevated using the iris scissors and clamps were used to ligate the vas deferens. The portion in between the clamps was excised and the ends of the vas were clamped using hemoclips, two in the testicular side and one on the proximal side. The incision was then inspected for hemostasis and closed with 3-0 chromic catgut interrupted fashion. A similar procedure was carried out on the right side. Dry sterile dressings were applied and the patient put on a scrotal supporter. The procedure was then terminated."
Urology," PROCEDURE: Newborn circumcision. INDICATIONS: Parental preference. ANESTHESIA: Dorsal penile nerve block. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The baby was prepared and draped in a sterile manner. Lidocaine 1% 4 mL without epinephrine was instilled into the base of the penis at 2 o'clock and 10 o'clock. The penile foreskin was removed using a XXX Gomco. Hemostasis was achieved with minimal blood loss. There was no sign of infection. The baby tolerated the procedure well. Vaseline was applied to the penis, and the baby was diapered by nursing staff."
Urology," PROCEDURES: Cystourethroscopy and transurethral resection of prostate. COMPLICATIONS: None. ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Difficulty voiding. HISTORY: This 67-year old Hispanic male patient was admitted because of enlarged prostate and symptoms of bladder neck obstruction. Physical examination revealed normal heart and lungs. Abdomen was negative for abnormal findings. LABORATORY DATA: BUN 19 and creatinine 1.1. Blood group was A, Rh positive, Hemoglobin 13, Hematocrit 32.1, Prothrombin time 12.6 seconds, PTT 37.1. Discharge hemoglobin 11.4, and hematocrit 33.3. Chest x-ray calcified old granulomatous disease, otherwise normal. EKG was normal. COURSE IN THE HOSPITAL: The patient had a cysto and TUR of the prostate. Postoperative course was uncomplicated. The pathology report is pending at the time of dictation. He is being discharged in satisfactory condition with a good urinary stream, minimal hematuria, and on Bactrim DS one a day for ten days with a standard postprostatic surgery instruction sheet. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Enlarged prostate with benign bladder neck obstruction. To be followed in my office in one week and by Dr. ABC next available as an outpatient."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gross hematuria. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gross hematuria. OPERATIONS: Cystopyelogram, clot evacuation, transurethral resection of the bladder tumor x2 on the dome and on the left wall of the bladder. ANESTHESIA: Spinal. FINDINGS: Significant amount of bladder clots measuring about 150 to 200 mL, two cupful of clots were removed. There was papillary tumor on the left wall right at the bladder neck and one on the right dome near the bladder neck on the right side. The right ureteral opening was difficult to visualize, the left one was normal. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 78-year-old male with history of gross hematuria and recurrent UTIs. The patient had hematuria. Cystoscopy revealed atypical biopsy. The patient came in again with gross hematuria. The first biopsy was done about a month ago. The patient was to come back and have repeat biopsies done, but before that came into the hospital with gross hematuria. The options of watchful waiting, removal of the clots and biopsies were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT and PE were discussed. Morbidity and mortality of the procedure were discussed. Consent was obtained from the daughter-in-law who has the power of attorney in Florida. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The patient had been off of the Coumadin for about 4 days and INR had been reversed. The patient has significant amount of clot upon entering the bladder. There was a tight bladder neck contracture. The prostate was not enlarged. Using ACMI 24-French sheath, using Ellick irrigation about 2 cupful of clots were removed. It took about half an hour to just remove the clots. After removing the clots, using 24-French cutting loop resectoscope, tumor on the left upper wall near the dome or near the 2 o'clock position was resected. This was lateral to the left ureteral opening. The base was coagulated for hemostasis. Same thing was done at 10 o'clock on the right side where there was some tumor that was visualized. The back wall and the rest of the bladder appeared normal. Using 8-French cone-tip catheter, left-sided pyelogram was normal. The right-sided pyelogram was very difficult to obtain and there was some mucosal irritation from the clots. The contrast did go up to what appeared to be the right ureteral opening, but the mucosa seemed to be very much irritated and it was very difficult to actually visualize the opening. A little bit of contrast went out, but the force was not made just to avoid any secondary stricture formation. The patient did have CT with contrast, which showed that the kidneys were normal. At this time, a #24 three-way irrigation was started. The patient was brought to Recovery room in stable condition."
Urology," PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a 63-year-old executive who was seen by his physician for a company physical. He stated that he was in excellent health and led an active life. His physical examination was normal for a man of his age. Chest x-ray and chemical screening blood work were within normal limits. His PSA was elevated. IMAGING: Chest x-ray: Normal. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis: No abnormalities. LABORATORY: PSA 14.6. PROCEDURES: Ultrasound guided sextant biopsy of prostate: Digital rectal exam performed at the time of the biopsy showed a 1+ enlarged prostate with normal seminal vesicles. PATHOLOGY: Prostate biopsy: Left apex: adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, Gleason's score 3 + 4 = 7/10. Maximum linear extent in apex of tumor was 6 mm. Left mid region prostate: moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, Gleason's 3 + 2 = 5/10. Left base, right apex, and right mid-region and right base: negative for carcinoma. TREATMENT: The patient opted for low dose rate interstitial prostatic implants of I-125. It was performed as an outpatient on 8/10."
Urology," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Bladder cancer. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a history of gross hematuria. The patient presented to the emergency room near his hometown on 12/24/2007 for evaluation of this gross hematuria. CT scan was performed, which demonstrated no hydronephrosis or upper tract process; however, there was significant thickening of the left and posterior bladder wall. Urology referral was initiated and the patient was sent to be evaluated by Dr. X. He eventually underwent a bladder biopsy on 01/18/08, which demonstrated high-grade transitional cell carcinoma without any muscularis propria in the specimen. Additionally, the patient underwent workup for a right adrenal lesion, which was noted on the initial CT scan. This workup involved serum cortisol analysis as well as potassium and aldosterone and ACTH level measurement. All of this workup was found to be grossly negative. Secondary to the absence of muscle in the specimen, the patient was taken back to the operating room on 02/27/08 by Dr. X and the tumor was noted to be very large with significant tumor burden as well as possible involvement of the bladder neck. At that time, the referring urologist determined the tumor to be too large and risky for local resection, and the patient was referred to ABCD Urology for management and diagnosis. The patient presents today for evaluation by Dr. Y. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes condyloma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, undiagnosed COPD, peripheral vascular disease, and claudication. The patient denies coronary artery disease. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Includes bladder biopsy on 01/18/08 without muscularis propria in the high-grade TCC specimen and a gun shot wound in 1984 followed by exploratory laparotomy x2. The patient denies any bowel resection or GU injury at that time; however, he is unsure. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d. 2. Diltiazem 120 mg daily. 3. Hydrocodone 10/500 mg p.r.n. 4. Pravastatin 40 mg daily. 5. Lisinopril 20 mg daily. 6. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily. FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for any GU cancer, stones or other complaints. The patient states he has one uncle who died of lung cancer. He denies any other family history. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient smokes approximately 2 packs per day times greater than 40 years. He does drink occasional alcohol approximately 5 to 6 alcoholic drinks per month. He denies any drug use. He is a retired liquor store owner. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: He is a well-developed, well-nourished Caucasian male, who appears slightly older than stated age. VITAL SIGNS: Temperature is 96.7, blood pressure is 108/57, pulse is 75, and weight of 193.8 pounds. HEAD AND NECK: Normocephalic atraumatic. LUNGS: Demonstrate decreased breath sounds globally with small rhonchi in the inferior right lung, which is clear somewhat with cough. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender. The liver and spleen are not palpably enlarged. There is a large midline defect covered by skin, of which the fascia has numerous holes poking through. These small hernias are of approximately 2 cm in diameter at the largest and are nontender. GU: The penis is circumcised and there are no lesions, plaques, masses or deformities. There is some tenderness to palpation near the meatus where 20-French Foley catheter is in place. Testes are bilaterally descended and there are no masses or tenderness. There is bilateral mild atrophy. Epididymidis are grossly within normal limits bilaterally. Spermatic cords are grossly within normal limits. There are no palpable inguinal hernias. RECTAL: The prostate is mildly enlarged with a small focal firm area in the midline near the apex. There is however no other focal nodules. The prostate is grossly approximately 35 to 40 g and is globally firm. Rectal sphincter tone is grossly within normal limits and there is stool in the rectal vault. EXTREMITIES: Demonstrate no cyanosis, clubbing or edema. There is dark red urine in the Foley bag collection. LABORATORY EXAM: Review of laboratory from outside facility demonstrates creatinine of 2.38 with BUN of 42. Additionally, laboratory exam demonstrates a grossly normal serum cortisol, ACTH, potassium, aldosterone level during lesion workup. CT scan was reviewed from outside facility, report states there is left kidney atrophy without hydro or stones and there is thickened left bladder wall and posterior margins with a balloon inflated in the prostate at the time of the exam. There is a 3.1 cm right heterogeneous adrenal nodule and there are no upper tract lesions or stones noted. IMPRESSION: Bladder cancer. PLAN: The patient will undergo a completion TURBT on 03/20/08 with bilateral retrograde pyelograms at the time of surgery. Preoperative workup and laboratory as well as paper work were performed in clinic today with Dr. Y. The patient will be scheduled for anesthesia preop. The patient will have urine culture redrawn from his Foley or penis at the time of preoperative evaluation with anesthesia. The patient was counseled extensively approximately 45 minutes on the nature of his disease and basic prognostic indicators and need for additional workup and staging. The patient understands these instructions and also agrees to quit smoking prior to his next visit. This patient was seen in evaluation with Dr. Y who agrees with the impression and plan."
Urology, OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was taken to the operating room and was placed in the supine position on the operating room table. A general inhalation anesthetic was administered. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The urethral meatus was calibrated with a small mosquito hemostat and was gently dilated. Next a midline ventral type incision was made opening the meatus. This was done after clamping the tissue to control bleeding. The meatus was opened for about 3 mm. Next the meatus was calibrated and easily calibrated from 8 to 12 French with bougie sounds. Next the mucosal edges were everted and reapproximated to the glans skin edges with approximately five interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures. The meatus still calibrated between 10 and 12 French. Antibiotic ointment was applied. The procedure was terminated. The patient was awakened and returned to the recovery room in stable condition.
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left hydrocele. OPERATION: Left hydrocelectomy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left hydrocele. ANESTHESIA: General INDICATIONS AND STUDIES: This is a 67-year-old male with pain, left scrotum. He has had an elevated PSA and also has erectile dysfunction. He comes in now for a left hydrocelectomy. Physical exam confirmed obvious hydrocele, left scrotum, approximately 8 cm. Laboratory data included a hematocrit of 43.5, hemoglobin of 15.0, and white count 4700. Creatinine 1.3, sodium 141, and potassium 4.0. Calcium 8.6. Chest x-ray was unremarkable. EKG was normal. PROCEDURE: The patient was satisfactorily given general anesthesia, prepped and draped in supine position, and left scrotal incision was made, carried down to the tunica vaginalis forming the hydrocele. This was dissected free from the scrotal wall back to the base of the testicle and then excised back to the spermatic cord. In the fashion, the hydrocele was excised and fluid drained. Cord was infiltrated with 5 mL of 0.25% Marcaine. The edges of the tunica vaginalis adjacent to the spermatic cord were oversewn with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures for hemostasis. The left testicle was replaced into the left scrotal compartment and affixed to the overlying Dartos fascia with a 3-0 Vicryl suture through the edge of the tunica vaginalis and the overlying Dartos fascia. The left scrotal incision was closed, first closing the Dartos fascia with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures. Skin was closed with an interrupted running 4-0 chromic suture. A sterile dressing was applied. The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, upon awakening from general anesthesia. Plan is to discharge the patient and see him back in the office in a week or 2 in followup. Further plans will depend upon how he does."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right undescended testis (ectopic position). POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Right undescended testis (ectopic position), right inguinal hernia. PROCEDURES: Right orchiopexy and right inguinal hernia repair. ANESTHESIA: General inhalational anesthetic with caudal block. FLUIDS RECEIVED: 100 mL of crystalloids. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. SPECIMENS: No tissues sent to pathology. TUBES AND DRAINS: No tubes or drains were used. INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is an almost 4-year-old boy with an undescended testis on the right; plan is for repair. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room; surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed. He was then placed in the supine position and sterilely prepped and draped. Since the testis was in the ectopic position, we did an upper curvilinear scrotal incision with a 15-blade knife and further extended it with electrocautery. Electrocautery was also used for hemostasis. A subdartos pouch was then created with a curved tenotomy scissors. The tunica vaginalis was grasped with a curved mosquito clamp and then dissected from its gubernacular attachments. As we were dissecting it, we then found the testis itself into the sac, and we opened the sac, and it was found to be slightly atrophic about 12 mm in length and had a type III epididymal attachment, not being attached to the top. We then dissected the hernia sac off of the testis __________ some traction using the straight Joseph scissors and straight and curved mosquito clamps. Once this was dissected off, we then twisted it upon itself, and then dissected it down towards the external ring, but on traction. We then twisted it upon itself, suture ligated it with 3-0 Vicryl and released it, allowing it to spring back into the canal. Once this was done, we then had adequate length of the testis into the scrotal sac. Using a curved mosquito clamp, we grasped the base of the scrotum internally, and using the subcutaneous tissue, we tacked it to the base of the testis using a 4-0 chromic suture. The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation. The upper aspect of the pouch was closed with a pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic. The scrotal skin and dartos were then closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 chromic, and Dermabond tissue adhesive was used on the incision. IV Toradol was given. Both testes were well descended in the scrotum at the end of the procedure."
Urology," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Recurrent bladder tumor. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 79-year-old woman, the patient of Dr. X, who on recent followup cystoscopy for transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder neck was found to have a 5-cm area of papillomatosis just above the left ureteric orifice. The patient underwent TUR of several transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder on the bladder neck in 2006. This was followed by bladder instillation of BCG. At this time, the patient denies any voiding symptoms or hematuria. The patient opting for TUR and electrofulguration of the recurrent tumors. ALLERGIES: None known. MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 5 mg daily. OPERATIONS: Status post bilateral knee replacements and status post TUR of bladder tumors. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Other than some mild hypertension, the patient is in very, very good health. No history of diabetes, shortness of breath or chest pain. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Well-developed and well-nourished woman, alert and oriented. Her lungs are clear. Heart, regular sinus rhythm. Back, no CVA tenderness. Abdomen, soft and nontender. No palpable masses. IMPRESSION: Recurrent bladder tumors. PLAN: The patient to have CBC, chem-6, PT, PTT, EKG, and chest x-ray beforehand."

Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right lower pole renal stone and possibly infected stent. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right lower pole renal stone and possibly infected stent. OPERATION: Cysto stent removal. ANESTHESIA: Local MAC. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. FLUIDS: Crystalloid. MEDICATIONS: The patient was on vancomycin and Levaquin was given x1 dose. The patient was on vancomycin for the last 5 days. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 53-year-old female who presented with Enterococcus urosepsis. CT scan showed a lower pole stone with a stent in place. The stent was placed about 2 months ago, but when patient came in with a possibly UPJ stone with fevers of unknown etiology. The patient had a stent placed at that time due to the fevers, thinking that this was an urospetic stone. There was some pus that came out. The patient was cultured; actually it was negative at that time. The patient subsequently was found to have lower extremity DVT and then was started on Coumadin. The patient cannot be taken off Coumadin for the next 6 months due to the significant swelling and high risk for PE. The repeat films were taken which showed the stone had migrated into the pole. The stent was intact. The patient subsequently developed recurrent UTIs and Enterococcus in the urine with fevers. The patient was admitted for IV antibiotics since the patient could not really tolerate penicillin due to allergy and due to patient being on Coumadin, Cipro, and Levaquin where treatment was little bit more complicated. Due to drug interaction, the patient was admitted for IV antibiotic treatment. The thinking was that either the stone or the stent is infected, since the stone is pretty small in size, the stent is very likely possibility that it could have been infected and now it needs to be removed. Since the stone is not obstructing, there is no reason to replace the stent at this time. We are unable to do the ureteroscopy or the shock-wave lithotripsy when the patient is fully anticoagulated. So, the best option at this time is to probably wait and perform the ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy when the patient is allowed to off her Coumadin, which would be probably about 4 months down the road. Plan is to get rid of the stent and improve patient's urinary symptoms and to get rid of the infection and we will worry about the stone at later point. DETAILS OF THE OR: Consent had been obtained from the patient. Risks, benefits, and options were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed. The patient understood all the risks and benefits of removing the stent and wanted to proceed. The patient was brought to the OR. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was given some IV pain meds. The patient had received vancomycin and Levaquin preop. Cystoscopy was performed using graspers. The stent was removed without difficulty. Plan was for repeat cultures and continuation of the IV antibiotics."
Urology," PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient is a 46-year-old white male seen for annual physical exam and had an incidental PSA elevation of 4.0. All other systems were normal. PROCEDURES: Sextant biopsy of the prostate. Radical prostatectomy: Excised prostate including capsule, pelvic lymph nodes, seminal vesicles, and small portion of bladder neck. PATHOLOGY: Prostate biopsy: Right lobe, negative. Left lobe, small focus of adenocarcinoma, Gleason's 3 + 3 in approximately 5% of the tissue. Radical prostatectomy: Negative lymph nodes. Prostate gland showing moderately differentiated infiltrating adenocarcinoma, Gleason 3 + 2 extending to the apex involving both lobes of the prostate, mainly right. Tumor overall involved less than 5% of the tissue. Surgical margin was reported and involved at the apex. The capsule and seminal vesicles were free. DISCHARGE NOTE: Patient has made good post-op recovery other than mild urgency incontinence. His post-op PSA is 0.1 mg/ml."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Penoscrotal abscess. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Penoscrotal abscess. OPERATION: Incision and drainage of the penoscrotal abscess, packing, penile biopsy, cystoscopy, and urethral dilation. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 75-year-old male presented with penoscrotal abscess. Options such as watchful waiting, drainage, and antibiotics were discussed. Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, completely the infection turning into necrotizing fascitis, Fournier's gangrene were discussed. The patient already had significant phimotic changes and disfigurement of the penis. For further debridement the patient was told that his penis is not going to be viable, he may need a total or partial penectomy now or in the future. Risks of decreased penile sensation, pain, Foley, other unexpected issues were discussed. The patient understood all the complications and wanted to proceed with the procedure. DETAIL OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the OR. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Pictures were taken prior to starting the procedure for documentation. The patient had an open sore on the right side of the penis measuring about 1 cm in size with pouring pus out using blunt dissection. The penile area was opened up distally to allow the pus to come out. The dissection around the proximal scrotum was done to make sure there are no other pus pockets. The corporal body was intact, but the distal part of the corpora was completely eroded and had a fungating mass, which was biopsied and sent for permanent pathology analysis. Urethra was identified at the distal tip, which was dilated and using 23-French cystoscope cystoscopy was done, which showed some urethral narrowing in the distal part of the urethra. The rest of the bladder appeared normal. The prostatic urethra was slightly enlarged. There are no stones or tumors inside the bladder. There were moderate trabeculations inside the bladder. Otherwise, the bladder and the urethra appeared normal. There was a significantly fungating mass involving the distal part of the urethra almost possibility to have including the fungating wart or fungating squamous cell carcinoma. Again biopsies were sent for pathology analysis. Prior to urine irrigation anaerobic aerobic cultures were sent, irrigation with over 2 L of fluid was performed. After irrigation, packing was done with Kerlix. The patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition. Please note that 18-French Foley was kept in place. Electrocautery was used at the end of the procedure to obtain hemostasis as much as possible, but there was fungating mass with slight bleeding packing was done and tight scrotal Kling was applied. The patient was brought to Recovery in a stable condition after applying 0.5% Marcaine about 20 mL were injected around for local anesthesia."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: History of bladder tumor with abnormal cytology and areas of erythema. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: History of bladder tumor with abnormal cytology and areas of erythema. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Cystoscopy. 2. Bladder biopsy with fulguration. ANESTHESIA: IV sedation with local. SPECIMEN: Urine cytology and right lateral wall biopsies. PROCEDURE: After the consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and given IV sedation. He was then placed in dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in standard fashion. A #21 French cystoscope was then used to visualized the entire urethra and bladder. There was noted to be a narrowing of the proximal urethra, however, the scope was able to pass through. The patient was noted to have a previously resected prostate. On visualization of the bladder, the patient did have areas of erythema on the right as well as the left lateral walls, more significant on the right side. The patient did have increased vascularity throughout the bladder. The ________ two biopsies of the right lateral wall and those were sent for pathology. The Bovie cautery was then used to cauterize the entire area of the biopsy as well as surrounding erythema. Bovie was also utilized to cauterize the areas of erythema on the left lateral wall. No further bleeding was identified. The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room. He will have his defibrillator restarted and will followup with Dr. X in approximately two weeks for the result. He will be discharged home with antibiotics as well as pain medications. He is to restart his Coumadin not before Sunday."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Stress urinary incontinence, intrinsic sphincter deficiency. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Stress urinary incontinence, intrinsic sphincter deficiency. OPERATIONS: Cystoscopy, cystocele repair, BioArc midurethral sling. ANESTHESIA: Spinal. EBL: Minimal. FLUIDS: Crystalloid. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of hysterectomy, complained of urgency, frequency, and stress urinary incontinence. The patient had urodynamics done and a cystoscopy, which revealed intrinsic sphincter deficiency. Options such as watchful waiting, Kegel exercises, broad-based sling to help with ISD versus Coaptite bulking agents were discussed. Risks and benefits of all the procedures were discussed. The patient understood and wanted to proceed with BioArc. Risk of failure of the procedure, recurrence of incontinence due to urgency, mesh erosion, exposure, etc., were discussed. Risk of MI, DVT, PE, and bleeding etc., were discussed. The patient understood the risk of infection and wanted to proceed with the procedure. The patient was told that due to the intrinsic sphincter deficiency, we will try to make the sling little bit tighter to allow better urethral closure, which may put her a high risk of retention versus if we make it too loose, then she may leak afterwards. The patient understood and wanted to proceed with the procedure. DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. A Foley catheter was placed. Bladder was emptied. Two Allis clamps were placed on the anterior vaginal mucosa. Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine was applied, and hydrodissection was done. Incision was made. A bladder was lifted off of the vaginal mucosa. The bladder cystocele was reduced. Two stab incisions were placed on the lateral thigh over the medial aspect of the obturator canal. Using BioArc needle, the needles were passed through under direct palpation through the vaginal incision from the lateral thigh to the vaginal incision. The mesh arms were attached and arms were pulled back the outer plastic sheath and the excess mesh was removed. The mesh was right at the bladder neck to the mid-urethra, completely covering over the entire urethra. The sling was kept little tight, even though the right angle was easily placed between the urethra and the BioArc material. The urethra was coapted very nicely. At the end of the procedure, cystoscopy was done and there was no injury to the bladder. There was good efflux of urine with indigo carmine coming through from both the ureteral openings. The urethra was normal, seemed to have closed up very nicely with the repair. The vaginal mucosa was closed using 0 Vicryl in interrupted fashion. The lateral thigh incisions were closed using Dermabond. Please note that the irrigation with antibiotic solution was done prior to the BioArc mesh placement. The mesh was placed in antibiotic solution prior to the placement in the body. The patient tolerated the procedure well. After closure, Premarin cream was applied. The patient was told to use Premarin cream postop. The patient was brought to Recovery in stable condition. The patient was told not to do any heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, and no tub bath, etc., for at least 2 months. The patient understood. The patient was to follow up as an outpatient."

GENITOURINARY: The patient's external genitalia is markedly abnormal. There is a large pedunculated mass dangling from the glans of the penis at approximately the urethral meatus. This pedunculated mass is approximately 1.5 x 2 cm in size and pedunculated by a stalk that is approximately 2 mm in diameter. The patient appears to have condylomatous changes along the glans of the penis and on the shaft of the penis as well. There are no open lesions at this point. There is a small tear of the skin where the mass attaches to the glans near the urethral meatus. Bleeding is currently stanch, and there is no sign of secondary infection at this time. Bilateral testicles are descended and normal without pain or mass bilaterally. There is no inguinal adenopathy. EXTREMITIES: No edema. SKIN: Warm, dry, and intact. No rash or lesion. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: Non-emergency department courses. It is thought that this patient should proceed directly with a referral to Urology for excision and biopsy of this mass. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Penile mass. The patient does have a large pedunculated penile mass. He will be referred to the urologist who is on-call today. The patient will need this mass excised and biopsied. The patient verbalized understanding the plan of followup and is discharged in satisfactory condition from the ER."
Urology," PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Inguinal herniorrhaphy. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A standard inguinal incision was made and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery. The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated. The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel, and this incision was carried out to the external ring using Metzenbaum scissors. Having exposed the inguinal canal, the cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a Penrose drain was placed around the cord structures at the level of the pubic tubercle. This Penrose drain was then used to retract the cord structures as needed. Adherent cremasteric muscle was dissected free from the cord using Bovie electrocautery. The cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and the sac was found anteromedially to the cord structures. The sac was dissected free from the cord structures using a combination of blunt dissection and Bovie electrocautery. Once preperitoneal fat was encountered, the dissection stopped and the sac was suture ligated at the level of the preperitoneal fat using a 2-0 silk suture ligature. The sac was excised and went to Pathology. The ends of the suture were then cut and the stump retracted back into the abdomen. The Penrose drain was removed. The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery. The incision in the external oblique was approximated using a 3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion, thus reforming the external ring. The skin incision was approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped and draped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. A dressing consisting of a 2 x 2 and OpSite was then applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct. Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
Urology," PROCEDURE: Circumcision. Signed informed consent was obtained and the procedure explained. The child was placed in a Circumstraint board and restrained in the usual fashion. The area of the penis and scrotum were prepared with povidone iodine solution. The area was draped with sterile drapes, and the remainder of the procedure was done with sterile procedure. A dorsal penile block was done using 2 injections of 0.3 cc each, 1% plain lidocaine. A dorsal slit was made, and the prepuce was dissected away from the glans penis. A ** Gomco clamp was properly placed for 5 minutes. During this time, the foreskin was sharply excised using a #10 blade. With removal of the clamp, there was a good cosmetic outcome and no bleeding. The child appeared to tolerate the procedure well. Care instructions were given to the parents."
Urology," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62-year old male with a Gleason score 8 adenocarcinoma of the prostate involving the left and right lobes. He has a PSA of 3.1, with a prostate gland size of 41 grams. This was initially found on rectal examination with a nodule on the right side of the prostate, showing enlargement relative to the left. He has undergone evaluation with a bone scan that showed a right parietal lesion uptake and was seen by Dr. XXX and ultimately underwent an open biopsy that was not malignant. Prior to this, he has also had a ProstaScint scan that was negative for any metastatic disease. Again, he is being admitted to undergo a radical prostatectomy, the risks, benefits, and alternatives of which have been discussed, including that of bleeding, and a blood transfusion. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary stenting. History of high blood pressure, as well. He has erectile dysfunction and has been treated with Viagra. MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, Aspirin, Zocor, and Prilosec. ALLERGIES: Penicillin. SOCIAL HISTORY: He is not a smoker. He does drink six beers a day. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Remarkable for his high blood pressure and drug allergies, but otherwise unremarkable, except for some obstructive urinary symptoms, with an AUA score of 19. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: HEENT: Examination unremarkable. Breasts: Examination deferred. Chest: Clear to auscultation. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen: Soft and nontender. He has no hernias. Genitourinary: There is a normal-appearing phallus, prominence of the right side of prostate. Extremities: Examination unremarkable. Neurologic: Examination nonfocal. IMPRESSION: 1. Adenocarcinoma of the prostate. 2. Erectile dysfunction. PLAN: The patient will undergo a bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical retropubic prostatectomy. The risks, benefits, and alternatives of this have been discussed. He understands and asks that I proceed ahead. We also discussed bleeding and blood transfusions, and the risks, benefits and alternatives thereof."
Urology," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Urinary retention. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 66-year-old gentleman status post deceased donor kidney transplant in 12/07, who has had recurrent urinary retention issues since that time. Most recently, he was hospitalized on 02/04/08 for acute renal insufficiency, which was probably secondary to dehydration. He was seen by urology again at this visit for urinary retention. He had been seen by urology during a previous hospitalization and he passed his voiding trial at the time of his stent removal on 01/22/08. Cystoscopy showed at that time obstructive BPH. He was started on Flomax at the time of discharge from the hospital. During the most recent readmission on 02/04/08, he went back into urinary retention and he had had a Foley placed at the outside hospital. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for blurred vision, nasal congestion, and occasional constipation. Denies chest pain, shortness of breath or any rashes or lesions. All other systems were reviewed and found to be negative. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. End-stage renal disease, now status post deceased donor kidney transplant in 12/07. 2. Hypertension. 3. History of nephrolithiasis. 4. Gout. 5. BPH. 6. DJD. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1. Deceased donor kidney transplant in 12/07. 2. Left forearm and left upper arm fistula placements. FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for mother with an unknown type of cancer, possibly colon cancer or lung and prostate problems on his father side of the family. He does not know whether his father side of the family had any history of prostate cancer. HOME MEDICATIONS: 1. Norvasc. 2. Toprol 50 mg. 3. Clonidine 0.2 mg. 4. Hydralazine. 5. Flomax. 6. Allopurinol. 7. Sodium bicarbonate. 8. Oxybutynin. 9. Coumadin. 10. Aspirin. 11. Insulin 70/30. 12. Omeprazole. 13. Rapamune. 14. CellCept. 15. Prednisone. 16. Ganciclovir. 17. Nystatin swish and swallow. 18. Dapsone. 19. Finasteride. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: This is a well-developed, well-nourished male, in no acute distress. VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98, blood pressure 129/72, pulse 96, and weight 175.4 pounds. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6 systolic murmur. ABDOMEN: Right lower quadrant incision site scar well healed. Nontender to palpation. Liver and spleen not enlarged. No hernias appreciated. PENIS: Normal male genitalia. No lesions appreciated on the penis. Previous DRE showed the prostate of approximately 40 grams and no nodules. Foley in place and draining clear urine. The patient underwent fill and pull study, in which his bladder tolerated 120 ml of sterile water passively filling his bladder. He spontaneously voided without the Foley 110 mL. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 66-year-old male with signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, who has had recurrent urinary retention since the kidney transplant in 12/07. He passed his fill and pull study and was thought to self-catheterize in the event that he does incur urinary retention again. We discussed with Mr. Barker that he has a urologist closer to his home and he lives approximately 3 hours away; however, he desires to continue follow up with the urology clinic at MCG and has been set up for followup in 6 weeks. He was also given a prescription for 6 months of Flomax and Proscar. He did not have a PSA drawn today as he had a catheter in place, therefore his PSA could be falsely elevated. He will have PSA level drawn either just before his visit for followup."
Urology," ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Adenocarcinoma of the prostate. HISTORY: The patient is a 71-year-old male whose personal physician, Dr. X identified a change in the patient's PSA from 7/2008 (4.2) to 4/2009 (10.5).

Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Radiation cystitis. 2. Refractory voiding dysfunction. 3. Status post radical retropubic prostatectomy and subsequent salvage radiation therapy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Radiation cystitis. 2. Refractory voiding dysfunction. 3. Status post radical retropubic prostatectomy and subsequent salvage radiation therapy. TITLE OF OPERATION: Salvage cystectomy (very difficult due to postradical prostatectomy and postradiation therapy to the pelvis), Indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion, and omental pedicle flap to the pelvis. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal with epidural. INDICATIONS: This patient is a 65-year-old white male who in 1998 had a radical prostatectomy. He was initially dry without pads and then underwent salvage radiation therapy for rising PSA. After that he began with episodes of incontinence as well as urinary retention requiring catheterization. One year ago, he was unable to catheterize and was taken to the operative room and had cystoscopy. He had retained staple removed and a diverticulum identified. There were also bladder stones that were lasered and removed, and he had been incontinent ever since that time. He wears 8 to 10 pads per day, and this has affected his quality of life significantly. I took him to the operating room on January 16, 2008, and found diffuse radiation changes with a small capacity bladder and wide-open bladder neck. We both felt that his lower urinary tract was not rehabilitatable and that a continent cutaneous diversion would solve the number of problems facing him. I felt like if we could remove the bladder safely, then this would also provide a benefit. FINDINGS: At exploration, there were no gross lesions of the smaller or large bowel. The bladder was predictably sucked into the pelvic sidewall both inferiorly and laterally. The opened bladder, which we were able to remove completely, had a wide-open capacious diverticulum in its very distal segment. Because of the previous radiation therapy and a dissection down to the pelvis, I elected to place an omental pedicle flap to provide additional blood supply for healing as well in the pelvis and also under the pubic bone which was exposed inferiorly due to previous surgery and treatment. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the operative suite and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained, placed in the supine position, flexed over the anterosuperior iliac spine, and his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A nasogastric tube was placed as well as radial arterial line. He was given intravenous antibiotics for prophylaxis. A generous midline skin incision was made from the midepigastrium down to the symphysis pubis, deep into the rectus fascia, the rectus muscle separated in the midline, and exploration carried out with the findings described. Moist wound towels and a Bookwalter retractor were placed for exposure. We began by retracting the bowels by mobilizing the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure and elevating the terminal ileum up to the second and third portion of the duodenum. The ureter was identified as a crisis over the iliac vessels and dissected deep into pelvis and subsequently divided between clips. An identical procedure was performed in the left side with similar findings and the bowels were packed cephalad. We began then dissecting the bladder away from the pelvic side walls staying medial to both epigastric arteries. This was quite challenging because of the previous radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy. We essentially carved the bladder off of the pelvic sidewall inferiorly as best we could and then we were able to have enough freedom to identify the lateral pedicles, and these were taken between double clips approximately and clipped distally. We then approached things posteriorly and carefully dissected between the __________ and posterior bladder. There was some remnant seminal vesicle on the right as well as both remnant ejaculatory duct and we used this to dissect the longus safe plane anterior to the rectum. We then entered the bladder anteriorly as distal as we could and remove the bladder and what we thought was a bladder neck and this appeared to end in a diverticulum. We then peeled it off the remaining rectum and passed the specimen off the operative field. Bladder was irrigated with warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection was made for hemostasis. We then completely mobilized the omentum off of the proximal transverse colon. This allowed a generous flap to be able to be laid into the pelvis without tension. We then turned our attention to forming the Indiana pouch. I completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon. The colon was divided proximal to the middle colic using a GIA-80 stapler. I then divided the avascular plane of Treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum. The mesentery was then sealed with a LigaSure device and divided, and the bowel was divided with a GIA-60 stapler. We then performed a side-to-side ileo-transverse colostomy using a GIA-80 stapler, closing the open end with a TA 60. The angles were reinforced with silk sutures and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutures. We then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum, passed a 12-French Robinson catheter into the cecal segment, and plicated the ileum with 3 firings of the GIA-60 stapler. The ileocecal valve was then reinforced with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures as described by Rowland, et al, and following this, passage of an 18-French Robinson catheter was associated with the characteristic &quot;pop,&quot; indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve. As the patient had had a previous appendectomy, we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy. We then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 3-0 Vicryl sutures. The bowel segment was then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive applications of the SGIA Polysorb-75. Between the staple lines, Vicryl sutures were placed and the defects closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture ligatures. We then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis. The left ureter was mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an end-to-side anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures, and this was stented with a Cook 8.4-French ureteral stent, and this was secured to the bowel lumen with a 5-0 chromic suture. The right ureter was brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis. We then brought the stents out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 2-0 chromic suture. A 24-French Malecot catheter was placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture. The staple lines were then buried with a running 3-0 Vicryl two-layer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a TA 60 Polysorb suture. The pouch was filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight, and the ureteral anastomoses were intact. We then made a final inspection for hemostasis. The cecostomy tube was then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk sutures. We then matured our stoma through the umbilicus. We removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this. A portion of the ileum was removed and healthy, well-vascularized tissue was matured with interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures. We left an 18-French Robinson through the stomag and secured this to the skin with silk sutures. The Malecot and stents were also secured in a similar fashion. We matured the stoma to the umbilicus with interrupted chromic stitches. The stitch was brought out to the right upper quadrant and the Malecot to the left lower quadrant. A Large JP drain was placed in the pelvis dependent to the omentum pedicle flap as well as the Indiana pouch. The rectus fascia was closed with a buried #2 Prolene running stitch, tying a new figure-of-eight proximally and distally and meeting in the middle and tying it underneath the fascia. Subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and skin was closed with surgical clips. The estimated blood loss was 450 mL, and the patient received no packed red blood cells. The final sponge and needle count were reported to be correct. The patient was awakened and extubated, and taken on stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."
Urology," PROCEDURES: 1. Release of ventral chordee. 2. Circumcision. 3. Repair of partial duplication of urethral meatus. INDICATIONS: The patient is an 11-month-old baby boy who presented for evaluation of a duplicated urethral meatus as well as ventral chordee and dorsal prepuce hooding. He is here electively for surgical correction. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought back into operating room 35. After successful induction of general endotracheal anesthetic, giving the patient, preoperative antibiotics and after completing a preoperative time out, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A holding stitch was placed in the glans penis. At this point, we probed both urethral meatus. Using the Crede maneuver, we could see urine clearly coming out of the lower, the more ventral meatus. At this point, we cannulated this with a 6-French hypospadias catheter. We attempted to cannulate the dorsal opening, however, we were unsuccessful. We then attempted to place lacrimal probes and were also unsuccessful indicating this was incomplete duplication. At this point, we identified the band connecting both the urethral meatus and incised it with tenotomy scissors. We sutured both meatus together such that there was one meatus at the normal position at the tip of the glans. At this point, we made a circumcising incision around the penis and degloved the penis in its entirety relieving all chordee. Once all the chordee had been adequately released, we turned our attention to the circumcision. Excessive dorsal foreskin was removed from the skin and glans. Mucosal cuts were reapproximated with interrupted 5-0 chromic suture. Dermabond was placed over this and bacitracin was placed on this once dry. This ended the procedure. DRAINS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. URINE OUTPUT: Unrecorded. COMPLICATIONS: None apparent. DISPOSITION: The patient will now go under the care of Dr. XYZ, Plastic Surgery, for excision of scalp hemangioma."

Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right ureteral calculus. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right ureteropelvic junction calculus. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Cystourethroscopy. 2. Right retrograde pyelogram. 3. Right double-J stent placement 22 x 4.5 mm. FIRST SECOND ANESTHESIA: General. SPECIMEN: Urine for culture and sensitivity. DRAINS: 22 x 4.5 mm right double-J ureteral stent. PROCEDURE: After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to operating room and placed in the supine position. She was given general anesthesia and then placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. A #21 French cystoscope was then passed through the urethra into the bladder. There was noted to be some tightness of the urethra on passage. On visualization of the bladder, there were no stones or any other debris within the bladder. There were no abnormalities seen. No masses, diverticuli, or other abnormal findings. Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and attempts to pass to a cone tip catheter, however, the ureteral orifice was noted to be also tight and we were unable to pass the cone tip catheter. The cone tip catheter was removed and a glidewire was then passed without difficulty up into the renal pelvis. An open-end ureteral catheter was then passed ________ into the distal right ureter. Retrograde pyelogram was then performed. There was noted to be an UPJ calculus with no noted hydronephrosis. The wire was then passed back through the ureteral catheter. The catheter was removed and a 22 x 4.5 mm double-J ureteral stent was then passed over the glidewire under fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance. The stent was clear within the kidney as well as within the bladder. The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well. She will be discharged home. She is to follow up with Dr. X for ESWL procedure. She will be given prescription for Darvocet and will be asked to have a KUB x-ray done prior to her followup and to bring them with her to her appointment."
Urology," REASON FOR VISIT: Elevated PSA with nocturia and occasional daytime frequency. HISTORY: A 68-year-old male with a history of frequency and some outlet obstructive issues along with irritative issues. The patient has had history of an elevated PSA and PSA in 2004 was 5.5. In 2003, he had undergone a biopsy by Dr. X, which was negative for adenocarcinoma of the prostate. The patient has had PSAs as high as noted above. His PSAs have been as low as 1.6, but those were on Proscar. He otherwise appears to be doing reasonably well, off the Proscar, otherwise does have some irritative symptoms. This has been ongoing for greater than five years. No other associated symptoms or modifying factors. Severity is moderate. PSA relatively stable over time. IMPRESSION: Stable PSA over time, although he does have some irritative symptoms. After our discussion, it does appear that if he is not drinking close to going to bed, he notes that his nocturia has significantly decreased. At this juncture what I would like to do is to start with behavior modification. There were no other associated symptoms or modifying factors. PLAN: The patient will discontinue all caffeinated and carbonated beverages and any fluids three hours prior to going to bed. He already knows that this does decrease his nocturia. He will do this without medications to see how well he does and hopefully he may need no other additional medications other than may be changing his alpha-blocker to something of more efficacious."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral undescended testes. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral undescended testes. OPERATION PERFORMED: Bilateral orchiopexy. ANESTHESIA: General. HISTORY: This 8-year-old boy has been found to have a left inguinally situated undescended testes. Ultrasound showed metastasis to be high in the left inguinal canal. The right testis is located in the right inguinal canal on ultrasound and apparently ultrasound could not be displaced into the right hemiscrotum. Both testes appeared to be normal in size for the boy's age. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: As above, both testes appeared viable and normal in size, no masses. There is a hernia on the left side. The spermatic cord was quite short on the left and required Prentiss Maneuver to achieve adequate length for scrotal placement. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The boy was taken to the operating room, where he was placed on the operating table. General anesthesia was administered by Dr. X, after which the boy's lower abdomen and genitalia were prepared with Betadine and draped aseptically. A 0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated subcutaneously in the skin crease in the left groin in the area of the intended incision. An inguinal incision was then made through this area, carried through the subcutaneous tissues to the anterior fascia. External ring was exposed with dissection as well. The fascia was opened in direction of its fibers exposing the testes, which lay high in the canal. The testes were freed with dissection by removing cremasteric and spermatic fascia. The hernia sac was separated from the cord, twisted and suture ligated at the internal ring. Lateral investing bands of the spermatic cords were divided high into the inguinal internal ring. However, this would only allow placement of the testes in the upper scrotum with some tension. Therefore, the left inguinal canal was incised and the inferior epigastric artery and vein were ligated with #4-0 Vicryl and divided. This maneuver allowed for placement of the testes in the upper scrotum without tension. A sub dartos pouch was created by separating the abdominal fascia from the scrotal skin after making an incision in the left hemiscrotum in the direction of the vessel. The testes were then brought into the pouch and anchored with interrupted #4-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was approximated with interrupted #5-0 chromic catgut sutures. Inspection of the spermatic cord in the inguinal area revealed no twisting and the testicular cover was good. Internal oblique muscle was approximated to the shelving edge and Poupart ligament with interrupted #4-0 Vicryl over the spermatic cord and the external oblique fascia was closed with running #4-0 Vicryl suture. Additional 7 mL of Marcaine was infiltrated subfascially and the skin was closed with running #5-0 subcuticular after placing several #4-0 Vicryl approximating sutures in the subcutaneous tissues. Attention was then turned to the opposite side, where an orchiopexy was performed in a similar fashion. However, on this side, there was no inguinal hernia. The testes were located in a superficial pouch of the inguinal canal and there was adequate length on the spermatic cord, so that the Prentiss maneuver was not required on this side. The sub dartos pouch was created in a similar fashion and the wounds were closed similarly as well. The inguinal and scrotal incisions were cleansed after completion of the procedure. Steri-Strips and Tegaderm were applied to the inguinal incisions and collodion to the scrotal incision. The child was then awakened and transported to post-anesthetic recovery area apparently in satisfactory condition. Instrument and sponge counts were correct. There were no apparent complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 20 to 30 mL."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right inguinal hernia. ANESTHESIA: General. PROCEDURE: Right inguinal hernia repair. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 4-year-old boy with a right inguinal bulge, which comes and goes with Valsalva standing and some increased physical activity. He had an inguinal hernia on physical exam in the Pediatric Surgery Clinic and is here now for elective repair. We met with his parents and explained the surgical technique, risks, and talked to them about trying to perform a diagnostic laparoscopic look at the contralateral side to rule out an occult hernia. All their questions have been answered and they agreed with the plan. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient had a well developed, but rather thin walled hernia sac on the right. The thinness of hernia sac made it difficult to safely cannulate through the sac for the laparoscopy. Therefore, high ligation was performed, and we aborted the plan for laparoscopic view of the left side. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient came to operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia. Surgical time-out was conducted while we were preparing and draping his abdomen with chlorhexidine based prep solution. During our time-out, we reiterated the patient's name, medical record number, weight, allergies status, and planned operative procedure. I then infiltrated 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine in the soft tissues around the inguinal crease in the right lower abdomen chosen for hernia incision. An additional aliquot of Marcaine was injected deep to the external oblique fascia performing the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block. A curvilinear incision was made with a scalpel and a combination of electrocautery and some blunt dissection and scissor dissection was used to clear the tissue layers through Scarpa fascia and expose the external oblique. After the oblique layers were opened, the cord structure were identified and elevated. The hernia sac was carefully separated from the spermatic cord structures and control of the sac was obtained. Dissection of the hernia sac back to the peritoneal reflection at the level of deep inguinal ring was performed. I attempted to gently pass a 3-mm trocar through the hernia sac, but it was rather difficult and I became fearful that the sac would be torn in proximal control and mass ligation would be less effective. I aborted the laparoscopic approach and performed a high ligation using transfixing and a simple mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl. The excess sac was trimmed and the spermatic cord structures were replaced. The external oblique fascia and Scarpa layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips. The patient tolerated the operation well. Blood loss was less than 5 mL. The hernia sac was submitted for specimen, and he was then taken to the recovery room in good condition."
Urology, CIRCUMCISION After informed consent was obtained the baby was placed on the circumcision tray. He was prepped in a sterile fashion times 3 with Betadine and then draped in a sterile fashion. Then 0.2 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected at 10 and 2 o'clock. A ring block was also done using another 0.3 mL of lidocaine. Glucose water is also used for anesthesia. After several minutes the curved clamp was attached at 9 o'clock with care being taken to avoid the meatus. The blunt probe was then introduced again with care taken to avoid the meatus. After initial adhesions were taken down the straight clamp was introduced to break down further adhesions. Care was taken to avoid the frenulum. The clamps where then repositioned at 12 and 6 o'clock. The Mogen clamp was then applied with a dorsal tilt. After the clamp was applied for 1 minute the foreskin was trimmed. After an additional minute the clamp was removed and the final adhesions were taken down. Patient tolerated the procedure well with minimal bleeding noted. Patient to remain for 20 minutes after procedure to insure no further bleeding is noted. Routine care discussed with the family. Need to clean the area with just water initially and later with soap and water or diaper wipes once healed.
Urology," OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating room table. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. An incision was made in the groin crease overlying the internal ring. This incision was about 1.5 cm in length. The incision was carried down through the Scarpa's layer to the level of the external oblique. This was opened along the direction of its fibers and carried down along the external spermatic fascia. The cremasteric fascia was then incised and the internal spermatic fascia was grasped and pulled free. A hernia sac was identified and the testicle was located. Next the internal spermatic fascia was incised and the hernia sac was dissected free inside the internal ring. This was performed by incising the transversalis fascia circumferentially. The hernia sac was ligated with a 3-0 silk suture high and divided and was noted to retract into the abdominal cavity. Care was taken not to injure the testicular vessels. Next the abnormal attachments of the testicle were dissected free distally with care not to injure any long loop vas and these were divided beneath the testicle for a fair distance. The lateral attachments tethering the cord vessels were freed from the sidewalls in the retroperitoneum high. This gave excellent length and very adequate length to bring the testicle down into the anterior superior hemiscrotum. The testicle was viable. This was wrapped in a moist sponge. Next a hemostat was passed down through the inguinal canal down into the scrotum. A small 1 cm incision was made in the anterior superior scrotal wall. Dissection was carried down through the dartos layer. A subdartos pouch was formed with blunt dissection. The hemostat was then pushed against the tissues and this tissue was divided. The hemostat was then passed through the incision. A Crile hemostat was passed back up into the inguinal canal. The distal attachments of the sac were grasped and pulled down without twisting these structures through the incision. The neck was then closed with a 4-0 Vicryl suture that was not too tight, but tight enough to prevent retraction of the testicle. The testicle was then tucked down in its proper orientation into the subdartos pouch and the subcuticular tissue was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was closed with a running 6-0 subcuticular chromic suture. Benzoin and a Steri-Strip were placed. Next the transversus abdominis arch was reapproximated to the iliopubic tract over the top of the cord vessels to tighten up the ring slightly. This was done with 2 to 3 interrupted 3-0 silk sutures. The external oblique was then closed with interrupted 3-0 silk suture. The Scarpa's layer was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was then closed with a running 4-0 Vicryl intracuticular stitch. Benzoin and Steri-Strip were applied. The testicle was in good position in the dependent portion of the hemiscrotum and the patient had a caudal block, was awakened, and was returned to the recovery room in stable condition."
Urology," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient presents today for followup. No dysuria, gross hematuria, fever, chills. She continues to have urinary incontinence, especially while changing from sitting to standing position, as well as urge incontinence. She is voiding daytime every 1 hour in the morning especially after taking Lasix, which tapers off in the afternoon, nocturia time 0. No incontinence. No straining to urinate. Good stream, emptying well. No bowel issues, however, she also indicates that while using her vaginal cream, she has difficulty doing this as she feels protrusion in the vagina, and very concerned if she has a prolapse. IMPRESSION: 1. The patient noted for improving retention of urine, postop vaginal reconstruction, very concerned of possible vaginal prolapse, especially while using the cream. 2. Rule out ascites, with no GI issues other than lower extremity edema. PLAN: Following a detailed discussion with the patient, she elected to proceed with continued Flomax and will wean off the Urecholine to two times daily. She will follow up next week, request Dr. X to do a pelvic exam, and in the meantime, she will obtain a CT of the abdomen and pelvis to further evaluate the cause of the abdominal distention. All questions answered."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral vesicoureteral reflux with right reflux nephropathy after Deflux injection. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral vesicoureteral reflux with right reflux nephropathy after Deflux injection. PROCEDURE: Cystoscopy under anesthesia, bilateral HIT/STING with Deflux under general anesthetic. ANESTHESIA: General inhalational anesthetic. FLUIDS RECEIVED: 250 mL crystalloids. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. SPECIMENS: Urine sent for culture. ABNORMAL FINDINGS: Gaping ureteral orifices, right greater than left, with Deflux not in or near the ureteral orifices. Right ureteral orifice was HIT with 1.5 mL of Deflux and left with 1.2 mL of Deflux. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 4-1/2-year-old boy with history of reflux nephropathy and voiding and bowel dysfunction. He has had a STING procedure performed but continues to have reflux bilaterally. Plan is for another injection. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, IV antibiotics were given. He was then placed in a lithotomy position with adequate padding of his arms and legs. His urethra was calibrated to 12-French with a bougie a boule. A 9.5-French cystoscope was used and the offset system was then used. His urethra was normal without valves or strictures. His bladder was fairly normal with minimal trabeculations but no cystitis noted. Upon evaluation, the patient's right ureteral orifice was found to be remarkably gaping and the Deflux that was present was not in or near ureteral orifice but it was inferior to it below the trigone. This was similarly found on the left side where the Deflux was not close to the orifice as well. It was slightly more difficult because of the amount impacted upon our angle for injection. We were able to ultimately get the Deflux to go ahead with HIT technique on the right into the ureter itself to inject a total of 1.5 mL to include the HIT technique as well as the ureteral orifice itself on the right and left sides and some on the uppermost aspect. Once we injected this, we ran the irrigant over the orifice and it no longer fluttered and there was no bleeding. Similar procedure was done on the left. This was actually more difficult as the Deflux injection from before displaced the ureter slightly more laterally but again HIT technique was performed. There was some mild bleeding and Deflux was used to stop this as well and again no evidence of fluttering of the ureteral orifice after injection. At the end of the procedure, the irrigant was drained and 2% lidocaine jelly was instilled in the urethra. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was in stable condition upon transfer to Recovery. A low-dose of IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure as well."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Urinary hesitancy and weak stream. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Urinary hesitancy and weak stream. 2. Urethral narrowing. 3. Mild posterior wall erythema. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Cystourethroscopy. 2. Urethral dilation. 3. Bladder biopsy and fulguration. ANESTHESIA: General. SPECIMEN: Urine culture sensitivity and cytology and bladder biopsy x1. DISPOSITION: To PACU in stable condition. INDICATIONS AND FINDINGS: This is a 76-year-old female with history of weak stream and history of intermittent catheterization secondary to hypotonic bladder in the past, last cystoscopy approximately two years ago. FINDINGS AT TIME OF SURGERY: Cystourethroscopy revealed some mild narrowing of the urethra, which was easily dilated to #23 French. A midureteral polyp was noted. Cystoscopy revealed multiple cellules and mild trabeculation of the bladder. Posterior wall revealed some mild erythema with some distorted architecture of the bladder mucosa. No obvious raised bladder tumor was noted. No foreign bodies were noted. The ureteral orifices were noted on the trigone just proximal to the bladder neck. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was moved to the operating room, general anesthesia was induced by the Department of Anesthesia. The patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion and urethral sounds used to dilate the urethra to accommodate #23 French cystoscope. Cystoscopy was performed in its entirety with the above findings. The small area of erythema on the posterior wall was biopsied using a flexible biopsy forceps and Bovie cautery was used to cauterize and fulgurate this area. The bladder was drained, cystoscope was removed, scope was reinserted and bladder was again reexamined. No evidence of active bleeding noted. The bladder was drained, cystoscope was removed, and the patient was cleaned and sent to recovery room in stable condition to followup with Dr. X in two weeks. She is given prescription for Levaquin and Pyridium and given discharge instructions."
Urology," EXAM: Ultrasound examination of the scrotum. REASON FOR EXAM: Scrotal pain. FINDINGS: Duplex and color flow imaging as well as real time gray-scale imaging of the scrotum and testicles was performed. The left testicle measures 5.1 x 2.8 x 3.0 cm. There is no evidence of intratesticular masses. There is normal Doppler blood flow. The left epididymis has an unremarkable appearance. There is a trace hydrocele. The right testicle measures 5.3 x 2.4 x 3.2 cm. The epididymis has normal appearance. There is a trace hydrocele. No intratesticular masses or torsion is identified. There is no significant scrotal wall thickening. IMPRESSION: Trace bilateral hydroceles, which are nonspecific, otherwise unremarkable examination."
Urology," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 55-year-old female with a history of stroke, who presents today for followup of frequency and urgency with urge incontinence. This has been progressively worsening, and previously on VESIcare with no improvement. She continues to take Enablex 50 mg and has not noted any improvement of her symptoms. The nursing home did not do a voiding diary. She is accompanied by her power of attorney. No dysuria, gross hematuria, fever or chills. No bowel issues and does use several Depends a day. Recent urodynamics in April 2008, here in the office, revealed significant detrusor instability with involuntary urinary incontinence and low bladder volumes, and cystoscopy was unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Persistent frequency and urgency, in a patient with a history of neurogenic bladder and history of stroke. This has not improved on VESIcare as well as Enablex. Options are discussed. We discussed other options of pelvic floor rehabilitation, InterStim by Dr. X, as well as more invasive procedure. The patient and the power of attorney would like him to proceed with meeting Dr. X to discuss InterStim, which was briefly reviewed here today and brochure for this is provided today. Prior to discussion, the nursing home will do an extensive voiding diary for one week, while she is on Enablex, and if this reveals no improvement, the patient will be started on Ventura twice daily and prescription is provided. They will see Dr. X with a prior voiding diary, which is again discussed. All questions answered. PLAN: As above, the patient will be scheduled to meet with Dr. X to discuss option of InterStim, and will be accompanied by her power of attorney. In the meantime, Sanctura prescription is provided, and voiding diaries are provided. All questions answered."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DX: Stress urinary incontinence. POSTOPERATIVE DX: Stress urinary incontinence. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: SPARC suburethral sling. ANESTHESIA: General. FINDINGS & INDICATIONS: Outpatient evaluation was consistent with urethral hypermobility, stress urinary incontinence. Intraoperatively, the bladder appeared normal with the exception of some minor trabeculations. The ureteral orifices were normal bilaterally. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: This patient was brought to the operating room, a general anesthetic was administered. She was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. Her vulva, vagina, and perineum were prepped with Betadine scrubbed in solution. She was draped in usual sterile fashion. A Sims retractor was placed into the vagina and Foley catheter was inserted into the bladder. Two Allis clamps were placed over the mid urethra. This area was injected with 0.50% lidocaine containing 1:200,000 epinephrine solution. Two areas suprapubically on either side of midline were injected with the same anesthetic solution. The stab wound incisions were made in these locations and a sagittal incision was made over the mid urethra. Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect bilaterally to the level of the ischial pubic ramus. The SPARC needles were then placed through the suprapubic incisions and then directed through the vaginal incision bilaterally. The Foley catheter was removed. A cystoscopy was performed using a 70-degree cystoscope. There was noted to be no violation of the bladder. The SPARC mesh was then snapped onto the needles, which were withdrawn through the stab wound incisions. The mesh was snugged up against a Mayo scissor held under the mid urethra. The overlying plastic sheaths were removed. The mesh was cut below the surface of the skin. The skin was closed with 4-0 Plain suture. The vaginal vault was closed with a running 2-0 Vicryl stitch. The blood loss was minimal. The patient was awoken and she was brought to recovery in stable condition."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Recurrent bladder tumor. 2. History of bladder carcinoma. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right lateral wall bladder tumor of 1.5 cm in size. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Cystourethroscopy. 2. Bilateral retrograde pyelogram. 3. Transurethral resection of bladder tumor of 1.5 cm in size. ANESTHESIA: IV general. SPECIMEN: UA for culture and cytology as well as the resecting bladder tumor specimen. INDICATIONS: This is a 52-year-old white female with a history of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with previous transurethral resection of the bladder, low grade. The patient had on serial cystoscopy evidence of recurrent bladder tumor at the right posterior wall. CT and IVP were performed and there was some question at the distal ureters. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient. The informed consent was on the chart at the time of procedure. PROCEDURE DETAILS: The patient did receive Levaquin antibiotics prior to the procedure. She was then wheeled to the Operative Suite and general anesthetic was administered. She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and placed in a dorsal lithotomy position. Next, with a #21 French cystoscope, cystourethroscopy was performed. Upon entering the bladder, the urethra was noted to be free of any stones, strictures, diverticulum, or calculi. The bladder was then surveyed. The trigone appeared normal. The ureteral orifices were in normal location and noted efflux of clear yellow urine. The reminder of the bladder was then surveyed. There were some areas of blanched scar tissue from previous resection. Of note, there was a exophytic bladder tumor on the right posterior wall approximately 1.5 cm in diameter. There was no other evidence of recurrent disease, strictures, or calculi. Next, with a #6 French open-ended ureteral catheter, right retrograde pyelogram was performed. The right ureter was noted to uptake contrast freely and there was no evidence of stone, stricture, diverticulum, calculi or filling defects along the entire course of the ureter including the pelvicaliceal system. The catheter was removed and inserted into the left ureteral orifice and once again this appeared to be entirely normal left collecting system with no evidence of stone, stricture, diverticulum, filling defect or other tumor. The bladder was drained and irrigant was switched to glycine and then using the #26 French resectoscope this was assembled and passed into the bladder via the visual obturator. After entering the bladder, the EndoSheath equipped with a _______ resection loop was inserted. The power settings were set at 100 cut and 40 coag and the bladder tumor of the right posterior wall was then resected in its entirety and the entire tumor bed and lateral margins were then fulgurated with cautery. There was no evidence of tumor at the end of the resection. The specimens were collected and then passed off for pathological evaluation. The bladder was then drained and the procedure was terminated. The plan would be for the patient to be discharged home with Levaquin, Urised, and Vicodin. She is to follow up with Dr. X on 09/12/03 at 02:30 p.m. where we will review the pathology and possibly discuss BCG rather intravesical agent being the recurrent nature of this disease."
Urology," REASON FOR VISIT: Followup circumcision. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient had his circumcision performed on 09/16/2007 here at Children's Hospital. The patient had a pretty significant phimosis and his operative course was smooth. He did have a little bit of bleeding when he woke in recovery room, which required placement of some additional sutures, but after that, his recovery has been complete. His mom did note that she had to him a couple of days of oral analgesics, but he seems to be back to normal and pain free now. He is having no difficulty urinating, and his bowel function remains normal. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Today, The patient looks healthy and happy. We examined his circumcision site. His Monocryl sutures are still in place. The healing is excellent, and there is only a mild amount of residual postoperative swelling. There was one area where he had some recurrent adhesions at the coronal sulcus, and I gently lysed this today and applied antibiotic ointment showing this to mom had to especially lubricate this area until the healing is completed. IMPRESSION: Satisfactory course after circumcision for severe phimosis with no perioperative complications. PLAN: The patient came in followup for his routine care with Dr. X, but should not need any further routine surgical followup unless he develops any type of difficulty with this surgical wound. If that does occur, we will be happy to see him back at any time."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: Radical retropubic prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection. ANESTHESIA: General epidural ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 800 cc. COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: This is a 64-year-old man with adenocarcinoma of the prostate confirmed by needle biopsies. He has elected to undergo radical retropubic prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection. Potential complications include, but are not limited to: 1. Infection. 2. Bleeding. 3. Incontinence. 4. Impotence. 5. Deep venous thrombosis. 6. Recurrence of the cancer. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Epidural anesthesia was administered by the anesthesiologist in the holding area. Preoperative antibiotic was also given in the preoperative holding area. The patient was then taken into the operating room after which general LMA anesthesia was administered. The patient was shaved and then prepped using Betadine solution. A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was inserted into the bladder with clear urine drain. A midline infraumbilical incision was performed. The rectus fascia was opened sharply. The perivesical space and the retropubic space were developed bluntly. Bookwalter retractor was then placed. Bilateral obturator pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed. The obturator nerve was identified and was untouched. The margin for the resection of the lymph node bilaterally were the Cooper's ligament, the medial edge of the external iliac artery, the bifurcation of the common iliac vein, the obturator nerve, and the bladder. Both hemostasis and lymphostasis was achieved by using silk ties and Hemo clips. The lymph nodes were palpably normal and were set for permanent section. The Bookwalter retractor was then repositioned and the endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally using Metzenbaum scissors. The puboprostatic ligament was taken down sharply. The superficial dorsal vein complex over the prostate was bunched up by using the Allis clamp and then tied by using 2-0 silk sutures. The deep dorsal vein complex was then bunched up by using the Allis over the membranous urethral area. The dorsal vein complex was ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture on a CT-1 needle. The Allis clamp was removed and the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors. The urethra was then identified and was dissected out. The urethral opening was made just distal to the apex of the prostate by using Metzenbaum scissors. This was extended circumferentially until the Foley catheter could be seen clearly. 2-0 Monocryl sutures were then placed on the urethral stump evenly spaced out for the anastomosis to be performed later. The Foley catheter was removed and the posteriormost aspect of urethra and rectourethralis muscle was transected. The lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally to sweep the neurovascular bundles laterally on both sides. The plane between Denonvilliers' fascia and the perirectal fat was developed sharply. No tension was placed on the neurovascular bundle at any point in time. The prostate dissected off the rectal wall easily. Once the seminal vesicles were identified, the fascia covering over them were opened transversely. The seminal vesicles were dissected out and the small bleeding vessels leading to them were clipped by using medium clips and then transected. The bladder neck was then dissected out carefully to spare most of the bladder neck muscles. Once all of the prostate had been dissected off the bladder neck circumferentially the mucosa lining the bladder neck was transected releasing the entire specimen. The specimen was inspected and appeared to be completely intact. It was sent for permanent section. The bladder neck mucosa was then everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures. Inspection at the prostatic bed revealed no bleeding vessels. The sutures, which were placed previously onto the urethral stump, were then placed onto the bladder neck. Once the posterior sutures had been placed, the Foley was placed into the urethra and into the bladder neck. A 20-French Foley Catheter was used. The anterior sutures were then placed. The Foley was then inflated. The bed was straightened and the sutures were tied down sequentially from anteriorly to posteriorly. Mild traction of the Foley catheter was placed to assure the anastomosis was tight. Two #19-French Blake drains were placed in the perivesical spaces. These were anchored to the skin by using 2-0 silk sutures. The instrument counts, lab counts, and sponge counts were verified to be correct, the patient was closed. The fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS. Subcutaneous tissue was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl suture. Skin was approximated by using metallic clips. The patient tolerated the operation well."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer, Gleason score 4+3 with 85% burden and 8/12 cores positive. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer, Gleason score 4+3 with 85% burden and 8/12 cores positive. PROCEDURE DONE: Open radical retropubic prostatectomy with bilateral lymph node dissection. INDICATIONS: This is a 66-year-old gentleman who had an elevated PSA of 5. His previous PSAs were in the 1 range. TRUS biopsy revealed 4+3 Gleason score prostate cancer with a large tumor burden. After extensive counseling, the patient elected for retropubic radical prostatectomy. Given his disease burden, it was advised that an open prostatectomy is probably the standard of care to ensure entire excision. The patient consented and agreed to proceed forward. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room here. Time out was taken to properly identify the patient and procedure going to be done. General anesthesia was induced. The patient was placed in the supine position. The bed was flexed distant to the pubic area. The patient's lower abdominal area, pubic area, and penile and scrotal area were clipped, and then scrubbed with Hibiclens soap for three minutes. The patient was then prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion. Foley catheter was inserted sterilely in the field. Preoperative antibiotics were given within 30 minutes of skin incision. A 10 cm lower abdominal incision was made from the symphysis pubis towards the umbilicus. Dissection was taken down through Scarpa's fascia to the level of the anterior rectus sheath. The rectus sheath was then incised and the muscle was split in the middle. Space of rectus sheath was then entered. The Bookwalter ring was then applied to the belly, and the bladder was then retracted to the right side, thus exposing the left obturator area. The lymph node packet on the left side was then dissected. This was done in a split and roll fashion with the flimsy tissue, and the left external iliac vein was incised, and the tissues were then rolled over the left external iliac vein. Dissection was carried down from the left external iliac vein to the obturator nerve and up to the level of the pelvic sidewall. The proximal extent of dissection was the left hypogastric artery to the level of the node of Cloquet distally. Care was taken to avoid injury to the nerves. An accessory obturator vein was noted and was ligated. The same procedure was done on the right side with dissection of the right obturator lymph node packet, which was sent for pathologic evaluation. The bladder subsequently was retracted cephalad. The prostate was then defatted up to the level of the endopelvic fascia. The endopelvic fascia was then incised bilaterally, and the incision was then taken to the level of the puboprostatic ligaments. Vicryl stitch was then applied at the level of the bladder neck in order to control the bladder back bleeders. A Babcock was then applied around the dorsal venous complex over the urethra and the K-wire was then passed between the dorsal vein complex and the urethra by passing by the aid of a right angle. A 0-Vicryl stitch was then applied over the dorsal venous complex, which was then tied down and cinched to the symphysis pubis. Using a knife on a long handle, the dorsal venous complex was then incised using the K-wire as a guide. Following the incision of the dorsal venous complex, the anterior urethra was then incised, thus exposing the Foley catheter. The 3-0 Monocryl sutures were then applied going outside in on the anterior aspect of the urethra. The lateral edges of the urethra were also then incised, and two lateral stitches were also applied going outside end. The catheter was then drawn back at the level of membranous urethra, and a final posterior stitch was applied going outside end. The urethra was subsequently divided in its entirety. A Foley catheter was then taken out and was inserted directly into the bladder through the prostatic apex. The prostate was then entered cephalad, and the prostatic pedicles were then systematically taken down with the right angle clips and cut. Please note that throughout the case, the patient was noted to have significant oozing and bleeding partially from the dorsal venous complex, pelvic veins, and extensive vascularity that was noted in the patient's pelvic fatty tissue. Throughout the case, the bleeding was controlled with the aid of a clips, Vicryl sutures, silk sutures, and ties, direct pressure packing, and FloSeal. Following the excision of the prostatic pedicles, the posterior dissection at this point was almost complete. Please note that the dissection was relatively technically challenging due to extensive adhesions between the prostate and Denonvilliers' fascia. The seminal vesicle on the left side was dissected in its entirety; however, the seminal vesicle on the right side was adherently stuck to the Denonvilliers' fascia, which prompted the excision of most of the right seminal vesicle with the exception of the tip. Care was taken throughout the posterior dissection to preserve the integrity of the ureters. The anterior bladder neck was then cut anteriorly, and the bladder neck was separated from the prostate. Following the dissection, the 5-French feeding tubes were inserted bilaterally into the ureters thus insuring their integrity. Following the dissection of the bladder from the prostate, the prostate at this point was mobile and was sent for pathological evaluation. The bladder neck was then repaired using Vicryl in a tennis racquet fashion. The rest of the mucosa was then everted. The ureteral orifices and ureters were protected throughout the procedure. At this point, the initial sutures that were applied into the urethra were then applied into the corresponding position on the bladder neck, and the bladder neck was then cinched down and tied down after a new Foley catheter was inserted through the penile meatus and into the bladder pulling the bladder in position. Hemostasis was then adequately obtained. FloSeal was applied to the pelvis. The bladder was then irrigated. It was draining pink urine. The wound was copiously irrigated. The fascia was then closed using a #1 looped PDS. The skin wound was then irrigated, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion. At this point, the procedure was terminated with no complications. The patient was then extubated in the operating room and taken in stable condition to the PACU. Please note that during the case about 3600 mL of blood was noted. This was due to the persistent continuous oozing from vascular fatty tissue and pelvic veins as previously noted in the dictation."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. OPERATION PERFORMED: Radical retropubic nerve-sparing prostatectomy without lymph node dissection. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 450 mL. REPLACEMENT: 250 mL of Cell Saver and crystalloid. COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATIONS OF SURGERY: This is a 67-year-old man with needle biopsy proven to be Gleason 6 adenocarcinoma in one solitary place on the right side of the prostate. Due to him being healthy with no comorbid conditions, he has elected to undergo surgical treatment with radical retropubic prostatectomy. Potential complications include, but are not limited to: 1. Infection. 2. Bleeding. 3. Incontinence. 4. Impotence. 5. Injury to the adjacent viscera. 6. Deep venous thrombosis. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Prophylactic antibiotic was given in the preoperative holding area, after which the patient was transferred to the operating room. Epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia were administered by Dr. A without any difficulty. The patient was shaved, prepped, and draped using the usual sterile technique. A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was then placed with clear urine drained. A midline infraumbilical incision was performed by using a #10 scalpel blade. The rectus fascia and the subcutaneous space were opened by using the Bovie. Transversalis fascia was opened in the midline and the retropubic space and the paravesical space were developed bluntly. A Bookwalter retractor was then placed. The area of the obturator lymph nodes were carefully inspected and no suspicious adenopathy was detected. Given this patient's low Gleason score and low PSA with a solitary core biopsy positive, the decision was made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy. The endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally by using the Metzenbaum scissors. Opening was enlarged by using sharp dissection. Small perforating veins from the prostate into the lateral pelvic wall were controlled by using bipolar coagulation device. The dorsal aspect of the prostate was bunched up by using 2-0 silk sutures. The deep dorsal vein complex was bunched up by using Allis also and ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-eight fashion. With the prostate retracted cephalad, the deep dorsal vein complex was transected superficially using the Bovie. Deeper near the urethra, the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors. The urethra could then be easily identified. Nearly two-third of the urethra from anteriorly to posteriorly was opened by using Metzenbaum scissors. This exposed the blue Foley catheter. Anastomotic sutures were then placed on to the urethral stump using 2-0 Monocryl suture. Six of these were placed evenly spaced out anteriorly to posteriorly. The Foley catheter was then removed. This allowed for better traction of the prostate laterally. Lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally. This effectively released the neurovascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate. Continued dissection from the lateral pelvic fascia deeply opened up the plane into the perirectal fat. The prostate was then dissected from laterally to medially from this opening in the perirectal fat. The floor of the urethra posteriorly and the rectourethralis muscle was then transected just distal to the prostate. Maximal length of ureteral stump was preserved. The prostate was carefully lifted cephalad by using gentle traction with fine forceps. The prostate was easily dissected off the perirectal fat using sharp dissection only. Absolutely, no traction to the neurovascular bundle was evident at any point in time. The dissection was carried out easily until the seminal vesicles could be visualized. The prostate pedicles were controlled easily by using multiple medium clips in 4 to 5 separate small bundles on each side. The bladder neck was then dissected out by using a bladder neck dissection method. Unfortunately, most of the bladder neck fiber could not be preserved due to the patient's anatomy. Once the prostate had been separated from the bladder in the area with the bladder neck, dissection was carried out posteriorly to develop a plane between the bladder and the seminal vesicles. This was developed without any difficulty. Both vas deferens were identified, hemoclipped and transected. The seminal vesicles on both sides were quite large and a decision was made to not completely dissect the tip off, as it extended quite deeply into the pelvis. About two-thirds of the seminal vesicles were able to be removed. The tip was left behind. Using the bipolar Gyrus coagulation device, the seminal vesicles were clamped at the tip sealed by cautery and then transected. This was performed on the left side and then the right side. This completely freed the prostate. The prostate was sent for permanent section. The opening in the bladder neck was reduced by using two separate 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The mucosa of the bladder neck was everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures. Small amount of bleeding around the area of the posterior bladder wall was controlled by using suture ligature. The ureteral orifice could be seen easily from the bladder neck opening and was completely away from the everting sutures. The previously placed anastomotic suture on the urethral stump was then placed on the corresponding position on the bladder neck. This was performed by using a French ***** needle. A 20-French Foley catheter was then inserted and the sutures were sequentially tied down. A 15 mL of sterile water was inflated to balloon. The bladder anastomosis to the urethra was performed without any difficulty. A 19-French Blake Drain was placed in the left pelvis exiting the right inguinal region. All instrument counts, lap counts, and latex were verified twice prior to the closure. The rectus fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS. Subcutaneous space was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was reapproximated by using metallic clips. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."

Urology," PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This 71-year-old man went to his primary care physician for a routine physical. His only complaints were nocturia times two and a gradual &quot;slowing down&quot; feeling. The physical examination on 1/29 was within normal limits except for the digital rectal exam which revealed an asymmetric prostate gland with nodularity, R&gt;L. PSA was elevated. The differential diagnosis for the visit was abnormal prostate, suggestive of CA. IMAGING: CT pelvis: Irregular indentation of bladder. Seminal vesicles enlarged. Streaky densities in periprostatic fat consistent with transcapular spread to periprostatic plexus. Impression: prostatic malignancy with extracapsular extension and probable regional node metastasis. Bone scan: Negative for distant metastasis. LABORATORY: PSA 32.1 PROCEDURES: Transrectal needle biopsy of prostate. Pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical prostatectomy. PATHOLOGY: Prostate biopsy: Moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in the right lobe and poorly differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma in the left lobe of prostate. Lymphadenectomy and prostatectomy: Frozen section of removed pelvic lymph nodes demonstrated metastatic adenocarcinoma in one lymph node in the right obturator fossa. Therefore, the radical prostatectomy was canceled. Final pathology diagnosis: Pelvic lymphadenectomy; left obturator fossa, single negative lymph node. Right obturator fossa; metastatic adenocarcinoma in 1/5 lymph nodes. Largest involved node 1.5 cm. TREATMENT: Patient began external beam radiation therapy to the pelvis."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Refractory urgency and frequency. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Refractory urgency and frequency. OPERATION: Stage I and II neuromodulator. ANESTHESIA: Local MAC. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. FLUIDS: Crystalloid. The patient was given Ancef preop antibiotic. Ancef irrigation was used throughout the procedure. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 63-year-old female who presented to us with urgency and frequency on physical exam. There was no evidence of cystocele or rectocele. On urodyanamcis, the patient has significant overactivity of the bladder. The patient was tried on over three to four different anticholinergic agents such as Detrol, Ditropan, Sanctura, and VESIcare for at least one month each. The patient had pretty much failure from each of the procedure. The patient had less than 20% improvement with anticholinergics. Options such as continuously trying anticholinergics, continuation of the Kegel exercises, and trial of InterStim were discussed. The patient was interested in the trial. The patient had percutaneous InterStim trial in the office with over 70% to 80% improvement in her urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence. The patient was significantly satisfied with the results and wanted to proceed with stage I and II neuromodulator. Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed. Risk of failure of the procedure in the future was discussed. Risk of lead migration that the treatment may or may not work in the long-term basis and data on the long term were not clear were discussed with the patient. The patient understood and wanted to proceed with stage I and II neuromodulator. Consent was obtained. DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the OR. The patient was placed in prone position. A pillow was placed underneath her pelvis area to slightly lift the pelvis up. The patient was awake, was given some MAC anesthesia through the IV, but the patient was talking and understanding and was able to verbalize issues. The patient's back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Lidocaine 1% was applied on the right side near the S3 foramen. Under fluoroscopy, the needle placement was confirmed. The patient felt stimulation in the vaginal area, which was tapping in nature. The patient also had a pressure feeling in the vaginal area. The patient had no back sensation or superficial sensation. There was no sensation down the leg. The patient did have __________, which turned in slide bellows response indicating the proper positioning of the needle. A wire was placed. The tract was dilated and lead was placed. The patient felt tapping in the vaginal area, which is an indication that the lead is in its proper position. Most of the leads had very low amplitude and stimulation. Lead was tunneled under the skin and was brought out through an incision on the left upper buttocks. Please note that the lidocaine was injected prior to the tunneling. A pouch was created about 1 cm beneath the subcutaneous tissue over the muscle where the actual unit was connected to the lead. Screws were turned and they were dropped. Attention was made to ensure that the lead was all the way in into the InterStim. Irrigation was performed after placing the main unit in the pouch. Impedance was checked. Irrigation was again performed with antibiotic irrigation solution. The needle site was closed using 4-0 Monocryl. The pouch was closed using 4-0 Vicryl and the subcutaneous tissue with 4-0 Monocryl. Dermabond was applied. The patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition."
Urology," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient presents today as a consultation from Dr. ABC's office regarding the above. He was seen a few weeks ago for routine followup, and he was noted for microhematuria. Due to his history of kidney stone, renal ultrasound as well as IVP was done. He presents today for followup. He denies any dysuria, gross hematuria or flank pain issues. Last stone episode was over a year ago. No history of smoking. Daytime frequency 3 to 4 and nocturia 1 to 2, good stream, empties well with no incontinence. Creatinine 1.0 on June 25, 2008, UA at that time was noted for 5-9 RBCs, renal ultrasound of 07/24/2008 revealed 6 mm left intrarenal stone, with no hydronephrosis. IVP same day revealed a calcification over the left kidney, but without bilateral hydronephrosis. The calcification previously noted on the ureter appears to be outside the course of the ureter. Otherwise unremarkable. This is discussed. IMPRESSION: 1. A 6-mm left intrarenal stone, nonobstructing, by ultrasound and IVP. The patient is asymptomatic. We have discussed surgical intervention versus observation. He indicates that this stone is not bothersome, prefers observation, need for hydration with a goal of making over 2 liters of urine within 24 hours is discussed. 2. Microhematuria, we discussed possible etiologies of this, and the patient is agreeable to cystoscopy in the near future. Urine sent for culture and sensitivity. PLAN: As above. The patient will follow up for cystoscopy, urine sent for cytology, continue hydration. Call if any concern. The patient is seen and evaluated by myself."

COMPLICATIONS: None. CONDITION: Stable. PROCEDURE: The patient was placed in the supine position and sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. After 2% lidocaine was instilled, the anterior urethra is normal. The prostatic urethra reveals mild lateral lobe obstruction. There are no bladder tumors noted. IMPRESSION: The patient has some mild benign prostatic hyperplasia. At this point in time, we will continue with conservative observation. PLAN: The patient will follow up as needed."
Urology," EPIDIDYMECTOMY OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was placed in the supine position and prepped and draped in the usual manner. A transverse scrotal incision was made and carried down to the tunica vaginalis, which was opened. A small amount of clear fluid was expressed. The tunica vaginalis was opened and the testicle was brought out through this incision. The epididymis was separated off the surface of the testicle using a scalpel. With blunt and sharp dissection, the epididymis was dissected off the testicle. Bovie was used for hemostasis. The vessels going to the testicle were preserved without any obvious injury, and a nice viable testicle was present after the epididymis was removed from this. The blood supply to the epididymis was cauterized using a Bovie and the vas was divided with cautery also. There was no obvious bleeding. The cord was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine, as was the dartos tissue in the scrotum. The testicle was replaced in the scrotum. Skin was closed in two layers using 3-0 chromic catgut for the dartos and a subcuticular closure with the same material. A dry sterile dressing and compression were applied, and he was sent to the recovery room in stable condition."

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: A gentleman who is here today requesting voluntary sterility. Options were discussed for voluntary sterility and he has elected to proceed with a bilateral vasectomy. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room, and after appropriately identifying the patient, the patient was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion and placed in a supine position on the OR table. Then, 0.25% Marcaine without epinephrine was used to anesthetize the scrotal skin. A small incision was made in the right hemiscrotum. The vas deferens was grasped with a vas clamp. Next, the vas deferens was skeletonized. It was clipped proximally and distally twice. The cut edges were fulgurated. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained. Then, 4-0 chromic was used to close the scrotal skin on the right hemiscrotum. Next, the attention was turned to the left hemiscrotum, and after the left hemiscrotum was anesthetized appropriately, a small incision was made in the left hemiscrotum. The vas deferens was isolated. It was skeletonized. It was clipped proximally and distally twice. The cut edges were fulgurated. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained. Then, 4-0 chromic was used to close the scrotal skin. A jockstrap and sterile dressing were applied at the end of the case. Sponge, needle, and instruments counts were correct."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left distal ureteral stone. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left distal ureteral stone. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Cystopyelogram, left ureteroscopy, laser lithotripsy, stone basket extraction, stent exchange with a string attached. ANESTHESIA: LMA. EBL: Minimal. FLUIDS: Crystalloid. The patient was given antibiotics, 1 g of Ancef and the patient was on oral antibiotics at home. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 61-year-old female with history of recurrent uroseptic stones. The patient had stones x2, 1 was already removed, second one came down, had recurrent episode of sepsis, stent was placed. Options were given such as watchful waiting, laser lithotripsy, shockwave lithotripsy etc. Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, need for stent, and removal of the stent were discussed. The patient understood and wanted to proceed with the procedure. DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. A 0.035 glidewire was placed in the left system. Using graspers, left-sided stent was removed. A semirigid ureteroscopy was done. A stone was visualized in the mid to upper ureter. Using laser, the stone was broken into 5 to 6 small pieces. Using basket extraction, all the pieces were removed. Ureteroscopy all the way up to the UPJ was done, which was negative. There were no further stones. Using pyelograms, the rest of the system appeared normal. The entire ureter on the left side was open and patent. There were no further stones. Due to the edema and the surgery, plan was to leave the stent attached to the string and the patient was to pull the string in about 24 hours. Over the 0.035 glidewire, a 26 double-J stent was placed. There was a nice curl in the kidney and one in the bladder. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Please note that the string was kept in place and the patient was to remove the stent the next day. The patient's family was instructed how to do so. The patient had antibiotics and pain medications at home. The patient was brought to recovery room in a stable condition."
Urology," CIRCUMCISION - OLDER PERSON OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 4-0 silk suture is used as a stay-stitch of the glans penis. Next, incision line was marked circumferentially on the outer skin 3 mm below the corona. The incision was then carried through the skin and subcutaneous tissues down to within a layer of * fascia. Next, the foreskin was retracted. Another circumferential incision was made 3 mm proximal to the corona. The intervening foreskin was excised. Meticulous hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery. Next, the skin was reapproximated at the frenulum with a U stitch of 5-0 chromic followed by stitches at 12, 3, and 9 o'clock. The stitches were placed equal distance among these to reapproximate all the skin edges. Next, good cosmetic result was noted with no bleeding at the end of the procedure. Vaseline gauze, Telfa, and Elastoplast dressing was applied. The stay-stitch was removed and pressure held until bleeding stopped. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was returned to the recovery room in stable condition."
Urology," PROCEDURE: Elective male sterilization via bilateral vasectomy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Fertile male with completed family. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Fertile male with completed family. MEDICATIONS: Anesthesia is local with conscious sedation. COMPLICATIONS: None. BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. INDICATIONS: This 34-year-old gentleman has come to the office requesting sterilization via bilateral vasectomy. I discussed the indications and the need for procedure with the patient in detail, and he has given consent to proceed. He has been given prophylactic antibiotics. PROCEDURE NOTE: Once satisfactory sedation have been obtained, the patient was placed in the supine position on the operating table. Genitalia was shaved and then prepped with Betadine scrub and paint solution and were draped sterilely. The procedure itself was started by grasping the right vas deferens in the scrotum, and bringing it up to the level of the skin. The skin was infiltrated with 2% Xylocaine and punctured with a sharp hemostat to identify the vas beneath. The vas was brought out of the incision carefully. A 2-inch segment was isolated, and 1-inch segment was removed. The free ends were cauterized and were tied with 2-0 silk sutures in such a fashion that the ends double back on themselves. After securing hemostasis with a cautery, the ends were allowed to drop back into the incision, which was also cauterized. Attention was now turned to the left side. The vas was grasped and brought up to the level of the skin. The skin was infiltrated with 2% Xylocaine and punctured with a sharp hemostat to identify the vas beneath. The vas was brought out of the incision carefully. A 2-inch segment was isolated, and 1-inch segment was removed. The free ends were cauterized and tied with 2-0 silk sutures in such a fashion that the ends double back on themselves. After securing hemostasis with the cautery, the ends were allowed to drop back into the incision, which was also cauterized. Bacitracin ointment was applied as well as dry sterile dressing. The patient was awakened and was returned to Recovery in satisfactory condition."
Urology," The patient was placed in the supine position, prepped and draped in the usual manner. Circumferential proximal incisions were made on the foreskin and dissected down to the underlying tissue. Hemostasis was obtained with a needlepoint Bovie. The foreskin was dissected sharply off of the shaft of the penis. Hemostasis controlled. The proximal and distal penile coronal skin was reanastomosed using 4-0 chromic catgut in interrupted fashion. 0.25% Marcaine was used around the base of the penis for a pain block postoperatively and Vaseline soaked gauze wrapped around the penis loosely as a dressing. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the Recovery Room in stable condition."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left indirect inguinal hernia. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Repair of left inguinal hernia indirect. ANESTHESIA: Spinal with local. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated the procedure well, was transferred to recovery in stable condition. SPECIMEN: Hernia sac. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 60-year-old female that presented to Dr. X's office with complaints of a bulge in the left groin. The patient states that she noticed there this bulge and pain for approximately six days prior to arrival. Upon examination in the office, the patient was found to have a left inguinal hernia consistent with tear, which was scheduled as an outpatient surgery. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient was found to have a left indirect inguinal hernia. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient. The patient was brought to the operating suite. After spinal anesthesia and sedation given, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion. In the area of the left inguinal region just superior to the left inguinal ligament tract, the skin was anesthetized with 0.25% Marcaine. Next, a skin incision was made with a #10 blade scalpel. Using Bovie electrocautery, dissection was carried down to Scarpa's fascia until the external oblique was noted. Along the side of the external oblique in the direction of the external ring, incision was made on both sides of the external oblique and then grasped with a hemostat. Next, the hernia and hernia sac was circumferentially grasped and elevated along with the round ligament. Attention was next made to ligating the hernia sac at its base for removal. The hernia sac was opened prior grasping with hemostats. It was a sliding indirect hernia. The bowel contents were returned to abdomen using a #0 Vicryl stick tie pursestring suture at its base. The hernia sac was ligated and then cut above with the Metzenbaum scissors returning it to the abdomen. This was then sutured at the apex of the repair down to the conjoint tendon. Next, attention was made to completely removing the round ligament hernia sac which was again ligated at its base with an #0 Vicryl suture and removed as specimen. Attention was next made to reapproximate it at floor with a modified ______ repair. Using a #2-0 Ethibond suture in simple interrupted fashion, the conjoint tendon was approximated to the ilioinguinal ligament capturing a little bit of the floor of the transversalis fascia. Once this was done, the external oblique was closed over, reapproximated again with a #2-0 Ethibond suture catching each hump in between each repair from the prior floor repair. This was done in simple interrupted fashion as well. Next Scarpa's fascia was reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl suture. The skin was closed with running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl suture. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure very well and he was transferred to Recovery in stable condition. The patient had an abnormal chest x-ray in preop and is going for a CT of the chest in Recovery."
Urology," CYSTOSCOPY & VISUAL URETHROTOMY OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the usual manner under satisfactory general anesthesia. A Storz urethrotome sheath was inserted into the urethra under direct vision. Visualization revealed a stricture in the bulbous urethra. This was intubated with a 0.038 Teflon-coated guidewire, and using the straight cold urethrotomy knife, it was incised to 12:00 to allow free passage of the scope into the bladder. Visualization revealed no other lesions in the bulbous or membranous urethra. Prostatic urethra was normal for age. No foreign bodies, tumors or stones were seen within the bladder. Over the guidewire, a #16-French Foley catheter with a hole cut in the tip with a Cook cutter was threaded over the guidewire and inserted into the bladder and inflated with 10 mL of sterile water. He was sent to the recovery room in stable condition."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ectopic left testis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ectopic left testis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Left orchiopexy. ANESTHESIA: General. The patient did receive Ancef. INDICATIONS AND CONSENT: This is a 16-year-old African-American male who had an ectopic left testis that severed approximately one-and-a-half years ago. The patient did have an MRI, which confirmed ectopic testis located near the pubic tubercle. The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the proposed procedure were discussed with the patient. Informed consent was on the chart at the time of procedure. PROCEDURE DETAILS: The patient did receive Ancef antibiotics prior to the procedure. He was then wheeled to the operative suite where a general anesthetic was administered. He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and shaved in the area of the intended procedure. Next, with a #15 blade scalpel, an oblique skin incision was made over the spermatic cord region. The fascia was then dissected down both bluntly and sharply and hemostasis was maintained with Bovie electrocautery. The fascia of the external oblique, creating the external ring was then encountered and that was grasped in two areas with hemostats and sized with Metzenbaum scissors. This was then continued to open the external ring and was then carried cephalad to further open the external ring, exposing the spermatic cord. With this accomplished, the testis was then identified. It was located over the left pubic tubercle region and soft tissue was then meticulously dissected and cared to avoid all vascular and testicular structures. The cord length was then achieved by applying some tension to the testis and further dissecting any of the fascial adhesions along the spermatic cord. Once again, meticulous care was maintained not to involve any neurovascular or contents of the testis or vas deferens. Weitlaner retractor was placed to provide further exposure. There was a small vein encountered posterior to the testis and this was then hemostated into place and cut with Metzenbaum scissors and doubly ligated with #3-0 Vicryl. Again hemostasis was maintained with ligation and Bovie electrocautery with adequate mobilization of the spermatic cord and testis. Next, bluntly a tunnel was created through the subcutaneous tissue into the left empty scrotal compartment. This was taken down to approximately the two-thirds length of the left scrotal compartment. Once this tunnel has been created, a #15 blade scalpel was then used to make transverse incision. A skin incision through the scrotal skin and once again the skin edges were grasped with Allis forceps and the dartos was then entered with the Bovie electrocautery exposing the scrotal compartment. Once this was achieved, the apices of the dartos were then grasped with hemostats and supra-dartos pouch was then created using the Iris scissors. A dartos pouch was created between the skin and the supra-dartos, both cephalad and caudad to the level of the scrotal incision. A hemostat was then placed from inferior to superior through the created tunnel and the testis was pulled through the created supra-dartos pouch ensuring that anatomic position was in place, maintaining the epididymis posterolateral without any rotation of the cord. With this accomplished, #3-0 Prolene was then used to tack both the medial and lateral aspects of the testis to the remaining dartos into the tunica vaginalis. The sutures were then tied creating the orchiopexy. The remaining body of the testicle was then tucked into the supra-dartos pouch and the skin was then approximated with #4-0 undyed Monocryl in a horizontal mattress fashion interrupted sutures. Once again hemostasis was maintained with Bovie electrocautery. Finally the attention was made towards the inguinal incision and this was then copiously irrigated and any remaining bleeders were then fulgurated with Bovie electrocautery to make sure to avoid any neurovascular spermatic structures. External ring was then recreated and grasped on each side with hemostats and approximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion cephalad to caudad. Once this was created, the created ring was inspected and there was adequate room for the cord. There appeared to be no evidence of compression. Finally, subcutaneous layer with sutures of #4-0 interrupted chromic was placed and then the skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion. The patient had been injected with bupivacaine prior to closing the skin. Finally, the patient was cleansed. The scrotal support was placed and plan will the for the patient to take Keflex one tablet q.i.d. x7 days as well as Tylenol #3 for severe pain and Motrin for moderate pain as well as applying ice packs to scrotum. He will follow up with Dr. X in 10 to 14 days. Appointment will be made."

Plan is for repair. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient is taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and the patient's identification was verified. Once he was anesthetized, the caudal block was placed and IV antibiotics were given. He was then placed in a supine position and sterilely prepped and draped. Once he was prepped and draped, we used a straight mosquito clamp and went under the bridges and crushed them, and then excised them with a curved iris and curved tenotomy scissors. We removed the excessive skin on the shaft skin and on the glans itself. We then on the ventrum excised the bridge and did a Heinecke-Mikulicz closure with interrupted figure-of-eight and interrupted suture of 5-0 chromic. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis. Once this was done, we then used Dermabond tissue adhesive and Surgicel to prevent the bridges from returning again. IV Toradol was given at the end of procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well, was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room."

Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. OPERATION: Cystoscopy and removal of foreign objects from the urethra. BRACHYTHERAPY: Iodine 125. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. The patient was given Levaquin 500 mg IV preoperatively. Total seeds were 59. Activity of 0.439, 30 seeds in the periphery with 10 needles and total of 8 seeds at the anterior of the fold, 4 needles. Please note that the total needles placed on the top were actually 38 seeds and 22 seeds were returned back. BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 72-year-old male who presented to us with elevated PSA and prostate biopsy with Gleason 6 cancer on the right apex. Options such as watchful waiting, brachytherapy, radical prostatectomy, cryotherapy, and external beam radiation were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, incontinence, erectile dysfunction, urethral stricture, dysuria, burning pain, hematuria, future procedures, and failure of the procedure were all discussed. The patient understood all the risks, benefits, and options and wanted to proceed with the procedure. The patient wanted to wait until he came back from his summer vacations, so a one dose of Zoladex was given. Prostate size measured about 15 g in the OR and about 22 g about two months ago. Consent was obtained. DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient had a Foley catheter placed sterilely. The scrotum was taped up using Ioban. Transrectal ultrasound was done. The prostate was measured 15 g. Multiple images were taken. A volume study was done. This was given to the physicist, Dr. X was present who is radiation oncologist who helped with implanting of the seeds. Total of 38 seeds were placed in the patient with 10 peripheral needles and then 4 internal needles. Total of 30 seeds were placed in the periphery and total of 8 seeds were placed in the inside. They were done directly under transrectal ultrasound vision. The seeds were placed directly under ultrasound guidance. There was a nice distribution of the seeds. A couple of more seeds were placed on the right side due to the location of the prostate cancer. Subsequently at the end of the procedure, fluoroscopy was done. Couple of images were obtained. Cystoscopy was done at the end of the procedure where a seed was visualized right in the urethra, which was grasped and pulled out using grasper, which was difficult to get the seed off of the spacers, which was actually pulled out. There were no further seeds visualized in the bladder. The bladder appeared normal. At the end of the procedure, a Foley catheter was kept in place of 18 French and the patient was brought to recovery in stable condition."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Nonfunctioning inflatable penile prosthesis. 2. Peyronie's disease. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Nonfunctioning inflatable penile prosthesis. 2. Peyronie's disease. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Ex-plantation of inflatable penile prosthesis and then placement of second inflatable penile prosthesis AMS700. ANESTHESIA: General LMA. SPECIMEN: Old triple component inflatable penile prosthesis. PROCEDURE: This is a 64-year-old male with prior history of Peyronie's disease and prior placement of a triple component inflatable penile prosthesis, which had worked for years for him, but has stopped working and subsequently has opted for ex-plantation and replacement of inflatable penile prosthesis. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: After informed consent, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position. General endotracheal intubation was performed by the Anesthesia Department and the perineum, scrotum, penis, and lower abdomen from the umbilicus down was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion in a 15-minute prep including iodine solution in the urethra. The bladder was subsequently drained with a red Robinson catheter. At that point, the patient was then draped in a sterile fashion and an infraumbilical midline incision was made and taken down through the subcutaneous space. Care was maintained to avoid all bleeding as possible secondary to the fact that we could not use Bovie cautery secondary to the patient's pacemaker and monopolar was only source of hemostasis besides suture. At that point, we got down to the fascia and the dorsal venous complex was easily identified as were both corporal bodies. Attention was taken then to the tubing, going up to the reservoir in the right lower quadrant. This was dissected out bluntly and sharply with Metzenbaum scissors and monopolar used for hemostasis. At this point, as we tracked this proximally to the area of the rectus muscle, we found that the tubing was violated and this was likely the source of his malfunctioned inflatable penile prosthesis. As we tried to remove the tubing and get to the reservoir, the tubing in fact completely broke as due to wire inside the tubing and the reservoir was left in its place secondary to risk of going after it and bleeding without the use of cautery. At that point, this tubing was then tracked down to the pump, which was fairly easily removed from the dartos pouch in the right scrotum. This was brought up into _________ incision and the two tubings going towards the two cylinders were subsequently tracked, first starting on the right side where a corporotomy incision was made at the placement of two #3-0 Prolene stay ties, staying lateral and anterior on the corporal body. The corporal body was opened up and the cylinder was removed from the right side without difficulty. However, we did have significant difficulty separating the tube connecting the pump to the right cylinder since this was surrounded by dense connective tissue and without the use of Bovie cautery, this was very difficult and was very time consuming, but we were able to do this and attention was then taken to the left side where the left proximal corporotomy was made after placement of two stick tie stay sutures. This was done anterior and lateral staying away from the neurovascular bundle in the midline and this was done proximally on the corporal body. The left cylinder was then subsequently explanted and this was very difficult as well trying to tract the tubing from the left cylinder across the midline back to the right pump since this was also densely scarred in and _________ a small amount of bleeding, which was controlled with monopolar and cautery was used on three different occasions, but just simple small burst under the guidance of anesthesia and there was no ectopy noted. After removal of half of the pump, all the tubing, and both cylinders, these were passed off the table as specimen. Both corporal bodies were then dilated with the Pratt dilators. These were already fairly well dilated secondary to explantation of our cylinders and antibiotic irrigation was copiously used at this point and irrigated out both of our corporal spaces. At this point, using the Farlow device, corporal bodies were measured first proximally then distally and they both measured out to be 9 cm proximally and 12 cm distally. He had an 18 cm with rear tips in place, which were removed. We decided to go ahead to and use another 18 cm inflatable penile prosthesis. Confident with our size, we then placed rear tips, originally 3 cm rear tips, however, we had difficulty placing the rear tips into the left crest. We felt that this was just a little bit too long and replaced both rear tips and down sized from 2 cm to 1 cm. At this point, we went ahead and placed the right cylinder using the Farlow device and the Keith needle, which was brought out through the glans penis and hemostated and the posterior rear tip was subsequently placed proximally, entered the crest without difficulty. Attention was then taken to the left side with the same thing was carried out, however, we did happen to dilate on two separate occasions both proximally and distally secondary to a very snug fit as well as buckling of the cylinders. This then forced us to down size to the 1 cm rear tips, which slipping very easily with the Farlow device through the glans penis. There was no crossover and no violation of the tunica albuginea. The rear tips were then placed without difficulty and our corporotomies were closed with #2-0 PDS in a running fashion. ________ starting on the patient's right side and then on the left side without difficulty and care was maintained to avoid damage or needle injury to the implants. At that point, the wound was copiously irrigated and the device was inflated multiple times. There was a very good fit and we had a very good result. At that point, the pump was subsequently placed in the dartos pouch, which already has been created and was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution. This was held in place with a Babcock as well not to migrate proximally and attention was then taken to our connection from the reservoir to the pump. Please also note that before placement of our pump, attention was then taken up to the left lower quadrant where an incision was then made in external oblique aponeurosis, approximately 3 cm dissection down underneath the rectus space was developed for our reservoir device, which was subsequently placed without difficulty and three simple interrupted sutures of #2-0 Vicryl used to close the defect in the rectus and at that point after placement of our pump, the connection was made between the pump and the reservoir without difficulty. The entire system pump and corporal bodies were subsequently flushed and all air bubbles were evacuated. After completion of the connection using a straight connector, the prosthesis was inflated and we had very good results with air inflation with good erection in both cylinders with a very slight deviation to the left, but this was able to be ________ with good cosmetic result. At that point, after irrigation again of the space, the area was simply dry and hemostatic. The soft tissue was reapproximated to separate the cylinder so as not to lie in rope against one another and the wound was closed in multiple layers. The soft tissue and the skin was then reapproximated with staples. Please also note that prior to the skin closure, a Jackson-Pratt drain was subsequently placed through the left skin and left lower quadrant and subsequently placed just over tubings, would be left in place for approximately 12 to 20 hours. This was also sutured in place with nylon. Sterile dressing was applied. Light gauze was wrapped around the penis and/or sutures that begin at the tip of the glans penis were subsequently cut and removed in entirety bilaterally. Coban was used then to wrap the penis and at the end of the case the patient was straight catheted, approximately 400 cc of amber-yellow urine. No Foley catheter was used or placed. The patient was awoken in the operative suite, extubated, and transferred to recovery room in stable condition. He will be admitted overnight to the service of Dr. McDevitt. Cardiology will be asked to consult with Dr. Stomel for a pacer placement and he will be placed on the Telemetry floor and kept on IV antibiotics."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral inguinal hernia. PROCEDURE: Bilateral direct inguinal hernia repair utilizing PHS system and placement of On-Q pain pump. ANESTHESIA: General with endotracheal intubation. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation and the abdomen and groins were prepped and draped in standard, sterile surgical fashion. I did an ilioinguinal nerve block on both sides, injecting Marcaine 1 fingerbreadth anterior and 1 fingerbreadth superior to the anterior superior iliac spine on both sides. I began on the right side by making an incision in a skin crease 1 fingerbreadth above the pubic tubercle. I dissected down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and through Scarpa's fascia. I identified the external ring and divided the external oblique up toward the anterior superior iliac spine. I located the ilioinguinal nerve and isolated it out of the wound. I encircled the cord structures and, dissecting out the cord structures, I did not visualize any sac. The floor of the inguinal canal was very loose and there was an obvious direct hernia. I cut open the floor and dissected out the preperitoneal space so I created a preperitoneal space. I took a PHS mesh system and took the posterior portion of the PHS mesh system and put it in through the hole in the floor of the inguinal canal. I made sure that it sat flat completely covering the myopectineal orifice. I then tacked the anterior part of the PHS mesh system to the pubic tubercle, superiorly to the internal oblique, inferiorly to the shelving edge of the inguinal ligament. I cut a hole in the mesh and recreated the internal ring and sewed it closed, making sure it was not too tight on the cord structures. I tucked the extended portion of the mesh underneath the external oblique between the external oblique and the internal oblique, thereby completing the hernia repair. I placed the ilioinguinal nerve back in its anatomical position. I then closed the external obliques with a running 3-0 Vicryl. I placed on On-Q pain pump through a separate stab incision utilizing a tear-away sheath catheter. I then closed Scarpa's fascia, the subcutaneous tissue and skin with a running Monocryl. I did the exact same procedure on the opposite side. On the left side, I cut a skin incision in the skin crease above the pubic tubercle. I dissected down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. I opened up Scarpa's fascia and identified the external ring. I opened up the external ring towards the anterior superior iliac spine. I isolated the ilioinguinal nerve so it was not damaged. I dissected out the cord and inspected the cord carefully. I did not see any sac there, but there was a weak direct floor with an obvious direct inguinal hernia. I opened the floor over this direct inguinal hernia. I cleared out the preperitoneal space and then placed the posterior portion of the PHS mesh system in place and made it lay out flat in order to cover the myopectineal orifice. I took the anterior portion of the mesh and tacked it to the pubic tubercle. I tacked the superior portion to the internal oblique, inferior portion to the shelving edge of the inguinal ligament. I cut a hole in order to incorporate the cord structures and sewed it back together. I made sure this was not too tight. I then tucked the extended portion of the mesh underneath the external oblique between the external oblique and the internal oblique. I returned the ilioinguinal nerve to its original position. I closed the external oblique with a running 3-0 Vicryl. I placed an On-Q pain pump through a separate stab incision and had the catheter thread right into the wound cavity. I then closed the Scarpa's fascia with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl suture. I closed the subcutaneous tissue with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl suture and closed the skin with running Monocryl. Sponge, instrument and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent right inguinal hernia, as well as phimosis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent right inguinal hernia, as well as phimosis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic right inguinal herniorrhaphy with mesh, as well as a circumcision. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition. SPECIMEN: Foreskin. BRIEF HISTORY: This patient is a 66-year-old African-American male who presented to Dr. Y's office with recurrent right inguinal hernia for the second time requesting hernia repair. The procedure was discussed with the patient and the patient opted for laparoscopic repair due to multiple attempts at the open inguinal repair on the right. The patient also is requesting circumcision with phimosis at the same operating time setting. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient was found to have a right inguinal hernia with omentum and bowel within the hernia, which was easily reduced. The patient was also found to have a phimosis, which was easily removed. PROCEDURE: After informed consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient. The patient was brought to operating suite, after general endotracheal intubation, prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion. An infraumbilical incision was made with a #15 Bard-Parker scalpel. The umbilical skin was elevated with a towel clip and the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty. Saline drop test proved entrance into the abdominal cavity and then the abdomen was insufflated to sufficient pressure of 15 mmHg. Next, the Veress was removed and #10 bladed trocar was inserted without difficulty. The 30-degree camera laparoscope was then inserted and the abdomen was explored. There was evidence of a large right inguinal hernia, which had omentum as well as bowel within it, easily reducible. Attention was next made to placing a #12 port in the right upper quadrant, four fingerbreadths from the umbilicus. Again, a skin was made with a #15 blade scalpel and the #12 port was inserted under direct visualization. A #5 port was inserted in the left upper quadrant in similar fashion without difficulty under direct visualization. Next, a grasper with blunt dissector was used to reduce the hernia and withdraw the sac and using an Endoshears, the peritoneum was scored towards the midline and towards the medial umbilical ligament and lateral. The peritoneum was then spread using the blunt dissector, opening up and identifying the iliopubic tract, which was identified without difficulty. Dissection was carried out, freeing up the hernia sac from the peritoneum. This was done without difficulty reducing the hernia in its entirety. Attention was next made to placing a piece of Prolene mesh, it was placed through the #12 port and placed into the desired position, stapled into place in its medial aspect via the 4 mm staples along the iliopubic tract. The 4.8 mm staples were then used to staple the superior edge of the mesh just below the peritoneum and then the patient was re-peritonealized, re-approximating edge of the perineum with the 4.8 mm staples. This was done without difficulty. All three ports were removed under direct visualization. No evidence of bleeding and the #10 and #12 mm ports were closed with #0-Vicryl and UR6 needle. Skin was closed with running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. Attention was next made to carrying out the circumcision. The foreskin was retracted back over the penis head. The desired amount of removing foreskin was marked out with a skin marker. The foreskin was then put on tension using a clamp to protect the penis head. A #15 blade scalpel was used to remove the foreskin and sending off as specimen. This was done without difficulty. Next, the remaining edges were retracted, hemostasis was obtained with Bovie electrocautery and the skin edges were re-approximated with #2-0 plain gut in simple interrupted fashion and circumferentially. This was done without difficulty maintaining hemostasis. A petroleum jelly was applied with a Coban dressing. The patient tolerated this procedure well and was well and was transferred to recovery after extubation in stable condition."
Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Benign prostatic hyperplasia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Benign prostatic hyperplasia. OPERATION PERFORMED: Transurethral electrosurgical resection of the prostate. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATIONS FOR THE SURGERY: This is a 77-year-old man with severe benign prostatic hyperplasia. He has had problem with urinary retention and bladder stones in the past. He will need to have transurethral resection of prostate to alleviate the above-mentioned problems. Potential complications include, but are not limited to: 1. Infection. 2. Bleeding. 3. Incontinence. 4. Impotence. 5. Formation of urethral strictures. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was identified, after which he was taken into the operating room. General LMA anesthesia was then administered. The patient was given prophylactic antibiotic in the preoperative holding area. The patient was then positioned, prepped and draped. Cystoscopy was then performed by using a #26-French continuous flow resectoscopic sheath and a visual obturator. The prostatic urethra appeared to be moderately hypertrophied due to the lateral lobes and a large median lobe. The anterior urethra was normal without strictures or lesions. The bladder was severely trabeculated with multiple bladder diverticula. There is a very bladder diverticula located in the right posterior bladder wall just proximal to the trigone. Using the ***** resection apparatus and a right angle resection loop, the prostate was resected initially at the area of the median lobe.
